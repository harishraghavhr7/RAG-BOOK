The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system
and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and
textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic
idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us
significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined
in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the
sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change i n school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days
are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation
will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at
school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus
designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child
psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appr eciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory gr oup in science and
mathematics, Pr ofessor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor V .B. Bhatia for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook. W e are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. W e are indebted to the institutions and or ganisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. W e are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring
Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,Foreword

This book is the outcome of the efforts of the textbook development committee
appointed by the NCER T. The committee met a few times to interact with one
another to improve the draft. Then there was a review meeting in which many
experts and practicing school teachers were invited to review the draft and suggest
improvements.
By and large we have stuck to the format of the Class VII book. By now famous
characters, Boojho and Paheli, have been used to make the text interactive. Attempt
has been made to recall children’s own experiences and build concepts around
them. This is designed to connect science that they study in the school with their
everyday life.
Many activities have been suggested to clarify concepts. Some of these activities
are so simple that children can perform them on their own. The requirement of the
apparatus r equir
ed for the activities is minimal. W e per formed all the activities
ourselves to ensure that there was no difficulty in performing them in the school
situation. The activities should also help children in developing skills such as
presentation of data in tabular and graphical forms, reasoning and drawing inference
from the given data.
The language of the book has been kept as simple as possible. A large number of
photographs, illustrations, cartoons, etc. have been included to make the book
attractive. To help teachers evaluate children effectively, a large number of exercises
have been given at the end of each chapter . The teachers are encouraged to frame
additional exercises to test children’s understanding. Some challenging exercises
have also been devised for those children who would like to appear for the National
Talent Sear ch Examination conducted by the NCER T.
We are conscious of the fact that ther e is a paucity of additional r eading material
for children. W e have tried to addr ess this pr oblem by pr oviding non-evaluative
boxes . These boxes, in light orange, contain additional information, anecdotes,
stories, strange facts and other such interesting materials.
We all know that children ar e mischievous and playful by natur e. Ther efore, in
order to prevent any untoward incident during the performance of the activities in
the school or outside, necessary cautions, in magenta, have been inserted at various
places in the book.
To prepare children to assume their roles as responsible citizens of tomorrow,
attempt has been made to sensitise them to the issues concer ning gender , religion,
envir onment, health and hygiene, water scar city and ener gy conservation. W e have
sought to weave into the text the value of cooperation and the importance of peer
learning.
An important feature of the book is what we call Extended Learning . These are
totally non-evaluative , and purely voluntary activities and projects. Some of the
projects in this section have been designed to enhance children’s interaction with
the experts, teachers, even parents, and society at large. The children are required
to collect information of various kinds and draw conclusions of their own.
My request to teachers and parents is to use the book in the spirit in which it
has been written. Encourage children to perform activities and learn by doing, rather
than by r ote. Y ou can supplement, or even r eplace, the activities given her e. If youPreface
2018-19


feel that you have better alter natives, especially with your local/r egional flavour ,
please write to us so that these activities could be used in the future editions of
the book.
We have been able to include only a small subset of childr en’s experiences. Y ou
have a better knowledge of their experiences because you are in touch with them.
Use them to illustrate the concepts being taught. Above all, please do not stifle
children’s natural curiosity. Encourage them to ask questions, even if sometimes
you feel uncomfortable. If you do not know the answer to a question on the spot, do
not feel embarrassed. Y ou can pr omise them to find the answer and deal with it
later. Make a genuine attempt to get the answer fr om whatever r esour ces ar e within
your reach, such as senior school or college teachers, experts, libraries, internet
etc. If, inspite of your efforts, you cannot get the answer to some question, you could
write to NCER T.
I must thank the NCER T for enabling us to talk to childr en thr ough the medium
of this book. Every member of the NCER T has been courteous and helpful to us.
In the end, I must express my gratitude to the members of the Editing Team,
who worked tirelessly to help me bring the book to the present form. If you and your
students find this book useful and enjoy teaching/learning science through this
book, the Editing Team and I shall consider ourselves well-rewarded.

To
The Head
Department of Education in
Science and Mathematics,
NCER T, Sri Aur obindo Mar g,
New Delhi 110016The team of Paheli and Boojho will be with you as you journey through this
textbook. They love to ask questions. All kinds of questions come to their
minds and they collect them in their sacks. Sometimes, they may share some
of the questions with you, as you read through the chapters.
Paheli and Boojho are also on the lookout for answers to many
questions — sometimes the questions seem answered after they discuss them
with each other , sometimes thr ough discussions with other classmates, teachers
or their parents. Answers to some questions do not seem available even after
all these. They might need to experiment on their own, read books in the library,
send questions to scientists. Just dig and dig and dig into all possibilities and
see if the questions can be answered. Perhaps, they would carry some of the
unanswered questions in their sacks to higher classes.
What will really thrill them would be your adding questions to their sacks
or answers to their questions. Sometimes, activities are suggested in the
textbook, results or findings of these by different groups of students would be
of inter est to other students and teachers. Y ou can complete the suggested
activities and send your results or findings to Paheli and Boojho. Do keep in
mind that activities that involve using blades, scissors or fire need to be done
strictly under the care of your teachers. Stick to the precautions given and
then enjoy doing all the suggested activities. Mind, the book will not be able to
help you much, if the activities are not completed!
We would like to advise you that you must make observations yourself
and record whatever results you get. Keen and true observations are necessary
for exploring any subject of study. For some reason your results may turn out
to be dif ferent fr om those of your classmates. Do not worry. T ry to find out the
reason for these results instead of disregarding them. Do not ever copy results
from your classmate.
You can send your feedback for Paheli and Boojho at:A Note for the Students

CROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT CROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT
Paheli and Boojho went to their
uncle’s house during the summer
vacation. Their uncle is a far mer
.
One day they saw some tools like khurpi ,
sickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field.
In order to provide food for a large
population— regular production, proper
management and distribution is
necessary.
1.1Agricultural Practices
Till 10,000 B.C.E. people wer e
nomadic. They were wandering in
groups from place to place in search
of food and shelter . They ate raw
fruits and vegetables and started
hunting animals for food. Later , they
could cultivate land and produce rice,
wheat and other food crops. Thus,
was born ‘Agriculture’.
When plants of the same kind are
cultivated at one place on a large scale,
it is called a crop. For example, crop of
wheat means that all the plants grown
in a field are that of wheat.
You alr eady know that cr ops ar e of
different types like cereals, vegetables
and fruits. These can be classified on the
basis of the season in which they grow.
India is a vast country. The climatic
conditions like temperature, humidity
and rainfall vary from one region to
another . Accor
dingly, ther e is a richYou have lear nt that all living
organisms require food. Plants can make
their food themselves. Can you recall
how green plants synthesise their own
food? Animals including humans can
not make their own food. So, where do
animals get their food from?
But, first of all why do we have to eat
food?
You alr eady know that energy fr om
the food is utilised by organisms for
carrying out their various body
functions, such as digestion, respiration
and excretion. W e get our food fr om
plants, or animals, or both.
Since we all need food,
how can we provide
food to a large number
of people in our
country?Food has to be
produced on a large
scale.
I want to know
where and how we
use these tools.

SCIENCE 2variety of crops grown in different parts
of the country. Despite this diversity,
two broad cropping patterns can be
identified. These are:
(i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are
sown in the rainy season are called
kharif crops. The rainy season in India
is generally fr om June to September .
Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and
cotton are kharif crops.
(ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the
winter season (October to March) are
called rabi crops. Examples of rabi
crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard
and linseed.
Besides these, pulses and vegetables
are grown during summer at many
places.
1.2Basic Practices of Crop
Productionto as agricultural practices  which are
listed below:
(i)Preparation of soil
(ii)Sowing
(iii)Adding manure and fertilisers
(iv)Irrigation
(v)Protecting from weeds
(vi)Harvesting
(vii)Storage
1.3 Preparation of Soil
The preparation of soil is the first step
before growing a crop. One of the most
important tasks in agriculture is to turn
the soil and loosen it. This allows the
roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The
loose soil allows the roots to breathe
easily even when they go deep into the
soil. Why does the loosening of soil allow
the roots to breathe easily?
The loosened soil helps in the growth
of earthworms and microbes present in
the soil. These organisms are friends of
the farmer since they further turn and
loosen the soil and add humus to it.
But why the soil needs to be turned and
loosened?
You have lear nt  in the pr evious
classes that soil contains minerals,
water , air and some living organisms.
In addition, dead plants and animals
get decomposed by soil organisms. In
this way, various nutrients in the dead
organisms are released back into the
soil. These nutrients are again absorbed
by plants.
Since only a few centimetres of the
top layer of soil supports plant growth,
turning and loosening of soil brings the
nutrient-rich soil to the top so that
plants can use these nutrients. Thus,Why  paddy can not be
grown in the winter season?
Paddy requires a lot of
water . Ther efore, it is gr own
only in the rainy season.
Cultivation of crops involves several
activities undertaken by farmers over a
period of time. Y ou may find that these
activities are similar to those carried out
by a gardener or even by you when you
grow ornamental plants in your house.
These activities or tasks are referred
2018-19


CROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 3turning and loosening of soil is very
important for cultivation of crops.
The process of loosening and turning
of the soil is called  tilling  or ploughing .
This is done by using a plough. Ploughs
are made of wood or iron. If the soil is
very dry, it may need watering before
ploughing. The ploughed field may have
big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is
necessary to break these crumbs.
Levelling the field is beneficial for
sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling
of soil is done with the help of a leveller .
Sometimes, manure is added to the
soil before tilling. This helps in proper
mixing of manure with soil. The soil is
moistened before sowing.
Agricultural Implements
Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to
break soil clumps to get better yield. This
is done with the help of various tools.
The main tools used for this purpose are
the plough, hoe and cultivator .Plough :  This is being used since
ancient times for tilling the soil, adding
fertili sers to the crop, removing the weeds
and turning the  soil. This is made of
wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or
other animals  (horses and camels) . It
contains a strong triangular iron strip
called ploughshare. The main part of the
plough is a long log of wood which is
called a ploughshaft. There is a handle
at one end of the shaft. The other end is
attached to a beam which is placed on
the bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a
man can easily operate the plough
[Fig. 1.1 (a)].
The indigenous wooden plough is
increasingly being replaced by iron
ploughs nowadays.
Hoe : It is a simple tool which is used
for removing weeds and for loosening
the soil. It has a long rod of wood or
iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of
iron is fixed to one of its ends and

SCIENCE 4Activity 1.1
Take a beaker and fill half of it
with water . Put a handful of wheat
seeds and stir well.  Wait for some
time.
Are there seeds which float on
water? W ould those be lighter or
heavier than those which sink? Why
would they be lighter? Damaged seeds
become hollow  and ar e thus lighter .
Therefor
e, they float on water .
This is a good method for
separating good, healthy seeds from
the damaged ones.
Before sowing , one of the important
tasks is to know about the tools used
for sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)].
Traditional tool : The tool used
traditionally for sowing seeds is
shaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The
seeds are filled into the funnel,
passed down through two or three
pipes having sharp ends. These
ends pierce into the soil and place
seeds there.Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is
done by tractor -driven cultivator . The
use of cultivator saves labour and time.

1.4 Sowing
Sowing is an important part of crop
production. Before sowing, good quality,
clean and healthy seeds of a good
variety —are selected. Farmers prefer to
use seeds which give high yield.

CROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 5Seed drill :  Nowadays the seed drill [Fig.
1.2 (b)] is used for sowing with the help
of tractors. This sows the seeds
uniformly at equal distance and depth.
It ensures that seeds get covered by the
soil after sowing. This protects seeds
from being eaten by birds. Sowing by
using a seed drill saves time and labour .Fig. 1.2 (b) :  A seed drill
There is a nursery near my
school. I found that little
plants were kept in small
bags. Why are they
kept like this?
Seeds  of a few plants
such as paddy are first
grown in a nursery. When
they grow into seedlings,
they are transplanted to
the field manually. Some
forest plants and flowering
plants are also grown in
the nursery.
Appropriate distance between the
seeds is necessary to avoid overcrowding
of plants. This allows plants to get

in a farm. In the neighbouring
farm, the plants were weak.
Why do some plants grow
better than others?sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water
from the soil. At times a few plants
may have to be removed to prevent
overcrowding.

Fertilisers

soil in the form of nutrients for the
healthy growth of plants are called
manure
 and fertilisers .
Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the
crop plants. These nutrients are
essential for the growth of plants. In
certain areas, farmers grow crop after
crop in the same field. The field is never
left uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what
happens to the nutrients?
Continuous cultivation of crops
makes the soil poor in nutrients.
Therefore, farmers have to add manure
to the fields to replenish the soil with
nutrients. This process is called
manuring . Improper or insufficient
manuring results in weak plants.
Manure is an organic substance
obtained from the decomposition of
plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump
plant and animal waste in pits at open
places and allow it to decompose. The
decomposition is caused by some
microorganisms. The decomposed
matter is used as organic manure.

Fertilisers are chemical s  which are
rich in a particular nutrient. How are
they different from manure? Fertilisers
are produced in factories. Some
examples of fertilisers are — urea,
ammonium sulphate, super
phosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,
Phosphorus, Potassium).
The use of fertilisers has helped
farmers to get  better yield of crops
such as wheat, paddy and maize. But
excessive use of fertilisers has made
the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have  also
become a source of water pollution.
Therefore, in order to maintain  the
fertility of the soil, we have to
substitute fertilisers with organic
manure or leave the field uncultivated
(fallow) in between two crops.
The use of manure improves soil
texture as well as its water retaining
capacity. It replenishes the soil with
nutrients.
Another method of replenishing
the soil with nutrients is through crop
rotation . This can be done by growing
different crops alter nately.  Earlier ,
farmers in northern India used to
grow legumes as fodder in one season
and wheat in the next season. This
helped in the replenishment of the soil
with nitrogen. Farmers are being
encouraged to adopt this practice.
In the previous classes, you have
learnt about Rhizobium  bacteria.
These are present in the nodules of
roots of leguminous plants. They fix
atmospheric nitrogen.

1.6 Irrigation
All living beings need water to live.
Water is important for pr oper gr owth
and development. W ater is absorbed by
the plant r oots. Along with water ,
minerals and fertilisers are also
absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%
water . Water is essential because
germination of seeds does not take place
under dry conditions. Nutrients
dissolved in water are transported to
each part of the plant. W ater alsoprotects the crop from both frost and
hot air currents. To maintain the
moisture of the soil for healthy crop
growth, fields have to be watered
regularly.
The supply of water to crops at
regular intervals is called irrigation . The
time and frequency of irrigation varies
from crop to crop, soil to soil and season
to season. In summer , the fr equency of
watering is higher . Why is it so? Could
it be due to the increased rate of
evaporation of water from the soil and
the leaves?Table 1.1 : Differences between Fertiliser and Manure

The water available in wells,
lakes and canals is lifted up
by different methods in
different regions, for taking it
to the fields.
Cattle or human labour is
used in these methods. So
these methods ar e cheaper ,

CROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 9Modern Methods of
Irrigation
Modern methods of irrigation
help us to use water
economically. The main
methods used are as follows:
(i)Sprinkler System: This
system is more useful on the
uneven land where sufficient
water is not available. The
perpendicular pipes, having
rotating nozzles on top, are
joined to the main pipeline
at regular intervals. When
water is allowed to flow
through the main pipe under pressure
with the help of a pump, it escapes from
the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled
on the crop as if it is raining.
Sprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee
plantation and several other crops
[Fig. 1.5 (a)].
Fig. 1.5 (b) :  Drip System
Fig. 1.5 (a) :  Sprinkler system
(ii)Drip system : In this system, the
water falls drop by drop directly near
the roots. So it is called drip system. It
is the best technique for watering fruit
plants,  gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)].
Water is  not wasted at all. It is a boon in
regions wher e availability of water is poor .

SCIENCE 101.7 Pr otection fr om W eeds
Boojho and Paheli went to a nearby
wheat field and saw that there were some
other plants in the field, growing along
with wheat plants.
Have these other
plants been planted
purposely?
In a field many other undesirable
plants may grow naturally along with
the crop. These undesirable plants are
called weeds .
The removal of weeds is called
weeding. W eeding is necessary since
weeds compete with the crop plants for
water , nutrients, space and light. Thus,
they affect the growth of the crop. Some
weeds inter fere even in harvesting and
may be poisonous for animals and
human beings.
Farmers adopt many ways to remove
weeds and contr ol their growth. T
illing
before sowing of crops helps in
uprooting and killing of weeds, which
may then dry up and get mixed with
the soil. The best time for the removal
of weeds is before they produce flowers
and seeds. The manual removal includes
physical removal of weeds by uprooting
or cutting them close to the ground,
from time to time. This is done with the
help of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]
is also used to uproot weeds.
Weeds ar e also controlled by using
certain chemicals, called weedicides ,
like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the
fields to kill the weeds. They do not
damage the crops. The weedicides are
diluted with water to the extent required
and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer .
(Fig. 1.6).
Do weedicides have any
effect on the person handling
the weedicide sprayer?Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide
As already mentioned, the  weedicides
are sprayed during the vegetative growth
of weeds before flowering and seed
formation. Spraying of weedicides may
affect the health of  farmer s. So they
should use these chemicals very carefully.
They should cover their nose and mouth
with a piece of cloth during spraying of
these chemicals.
1.8Harvesting
Harvesting of a crop is an important
task. The cutting of crop after it is
mature is called harvesting . In
harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut
close to the ground. It usually takes 3
to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.
Harvesting in our
country is either done
manually by sickle
(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine
called harvester . In the
harvested crop, the grain
seeds need to be separatedFig. 1.7 :
Sickle
2018-19


CROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 11from the chaff. This process is called
threshing . This is carried out with the
help of a machine called ‘combine’ which
is in fact a  harvester as well as a  thresher
(Fig. 1.8).
Fig. 1.8 :  Combine
After harvesting, sometimes
stubs are left in the field, which
are burnt by farmers. Paheli is
worried. She knows that it
causes pollution. It may also
catch fire and damage the crops
lying in the fields.
Harvest Festivals
After three or four months of hard
work there comes the day of the
harvest. The sight of golden fields
of standing crop, laden with grain,
fills the hearts of farmers with joy
and a sense of well -being. The
efforts of the past season have
borne fruit and it is time to relax
and enjoy a little. The period of
harvest is, thus, of great joy and
happiness in all parts of India.
Men and women celebrate it with
great enthusiasm. Special
festivals associated with the
harvest season are Pongal,
Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya
and Bihu.
1.9Storage
Storage of produce is an important task.
If the harvested grains are to be kept
for longer time, they should be safe
from moisture, insects, rats and
microorganisms. Harvested grains have
more moisture. If freshly harvested
grains (seeds) are stored without drying,
they may get spoilt or attacked by
organisms, making them unfit for use
or for  germination. Hence, before
storing them, the grains are properly
dried in the sun to reduce the moisture
in them. This prevents the attack by
insect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers with small holdings of land
do the separation of grain and chaff by
winnowing (Fig. 1.9). Y ou have alr
eady
studied this in Class VI.

Farmers store grains in jute bags or
metallic bins. However , large scale
storage of grains is done in silos  and
granaries  to protect them from pests
like rats and insects [Fig. 1.10 (a)
and (b)].
Dried neem leaves are used for
storing food grains at home. For storing
large quantities of grains in big

animals also provide us with different
kinds of food. Many people living in the
coastal areas consume fish as a major
part of their diet. In the previous classes
you have learnt about the food that we
obtain fr om plants. W e have just seen
that the process of crop production
involves a number of steps like selection
of seeds, sowing, etc. Similarly, animals
reared at home or in farms, have to be
provided with proper food, shelter and
care. When this is done on a large scale,
it is called animal husbandry.

MICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE MICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE
You have seen several kinds of
plants and animals. However ,
there are other living organisms
around us which we normally cannot
see. These are called microorganisms
or
 microbes . For example, you might
have observed that during the rainy
season moist bread gets spoilt and its
surface gets cover ed with gr eyish white
patches. Observe these patches through
a magnifying glass. Y ou will see tiny,
black rounded structures. Do you know
what these structures are and where d o
these come from?
2.1 Microorganisms
Activity 2.1
Collect some moist soil from the
field in a beaker and add water to
it. After the soil particles have
settled  down , observe a drop of
water from the beaker under a
microscope. What do you see ?
Activity 2.2
Take a few drops of water from a
pond. Spread on a glass slide and
observe through a microscope.
Do you find tiny organisms moving
around?These observations show that water
and soil are full of tiny organisms,
though not all of them fall into the
category of microbes. These
microorganisms or microbes are so
small in size that they cannot be seen
with the unaided eye. Some of these,
such as the fungus that grows on bread,
can be seen with a magnifying glass.
Others cannot be seen without the help
of a microscope. That is why these are
called microorganisms or microbes.
Microorganisms are classified into
four major groups. These groups are
bacteria , fungi ,  protozoa  and some
algae . Some of these common
microorganisms are shown in
Figs. 2.1 - 2.4.
Viruses are also microscopic but are
different from other microorganisms .
They, however , reproduce only inside the
cells of the host organism, which may be
a bacterium, plant or animal. Some of the
viruses are shown in Fig. 2.5. Common
ailments like cold, influenza (flu) and
most coughs are caused by viruses.
Serious diseases like polio and chicken
pox are also caused by viruses.
Diseases like dysentery and malaria
are caused by protozoa(protozoans)
whereas  typhoid and tuberculosis (TB)
are bacterial diseases.

Live?
Microorganisms may be single-celled
like bacteria, some algae and protozoa,
or multicellular , such as many algae and
fungi. They live in all types of
environment, ranging from ice cold
climate to hot springs; and deserts to
marshy lands. They are also found
inside the bodies of animals including
humans. Some microorganisms
grow on other organisms while others
exist freely.
2.3 Microorganisms and Us
Microorganisms play an important role
in our lives. Some of them are beneficial
in many ways whereas some others are
harmful and cause diseases. Let us
study about them in detail.Microorganisms have been used for
the production of alcohol since ages.Friendly Microorganisms
Microorganisms are used for various
purposes. They are used in the
preparation of curd, bread and cake.
Curd contains several micro-
organisms. Of these, the bacterium ,
Lactobacillus   promotes the formation
of curd. It multiplies in milk and
converts it into curd. Bacteria are also
involved in the making of cheese,
pickles and many other food items. An
important ingredient of rava (sooji)
idlis
 and bhaturas  is curd. Can you
guess why? Bacteria and yeast are also
helpful for fermentation of rice idlis
and dosa batter .
Fig. 2.5 :  Viruses
I saw that my mother
added a little curd to warm
milk to set curd for the
next day. I wonder why?They are also used in cleaning up
of the environment. For example, the
organic wastes (vegetable peels, remains
of animals,  faeces , etc.) are broken
down into harmless and usable
substances by bacteria. Recall that
bacteria are also used in the
preparation of medicines. In agriculture
they are used to increase soil fertility
by fixing nitrogen.

discovered
fermentation
in 1857.
In 1929, Alexander
Fleming was working
on a culture of disease-
causing bacteria.
Suddenly he found the
spores of a little green mould in one of
his culture plates. He observed that
the presence of mould prevented the
growth of bacteria. In fact, it also killed
many of these bacteria. From this the
mould penicillin was prepared.
This is the smell of alcohol as sugar
has been converted into alcohol by yeast.
This process of conversion of sugar into
alcohol is known as fermentation.Activity 2.3

Yeast r eproduces rapidly and
produces carbon dioxide during
respiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the
dough and increase its volume (Fig. 2.6).
This is the basis of the use of  yeast in
the baking industry for making breads,
pastries and cakes.
Commercial Use of Microorganisms
Microorganisms are used for the large scale
production of alcohol, wine and acetic acid
(vinegar). Y east is used for commer cial
production of alcohol and wine. For this
purpose yeast is grown on natural sugars
present in grains like barley, wheat, rice,
crushed fruit juices , etc.

Medicinal Use of Microorganisms
When ever you fall ill the doctor may
give you some antibiotic tablets,
capsules or injections such as of
penicillin. The source of these
medicines is microorganisms. These
medicines kill or stop the growth of the
disease -causing microorganisms. Such
medicines are called antibiotics . These
days a number of antibiotics are being
produced from bacteria and fungi.
Streptomycin, tetracycline and
erythromycin are some of the

MICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 21commonly known antibiotics which are
made from fungi and bacteria. The
antibiotics are manufactured by
growing specific microorganisms and
are used to cure a variety of diseases.
Antibiotics are even mixed with the
feed of livestock and poultry to check
microbial infection in animals. They are
also used to control many plant
diseases.
It is important to remember that
antibiotics should be taken only on
the advi ce of a qualified doctor . Also
you must complete  the course
prescribed by the doctor . If you take
antibiotics when not needed or in
wrong doses, it may make the drug
less effective when you might need
it in future. Also antibiotics taken
unnecessarily may kill the beneficial
bacteria in the body. Antibiotics,
however , are not ef fective against
cold and flu as these are caused by
viruses.
Vaccinefrom the disease-causing microbes for
ever. This is how a vaccine works.
Several diseases, including cholera,
tuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can
be prevented by vaccination.
Edward Jenner
discovered the
vaccine for small-
pox in 1798.
Why are children/infants
given vaccination?
When a disease-carrying microbe enters
our body, the body produces antibodies
to fight the invader . The body also
remembers how to fight the microbe if
it enters again. If dead or weakened
microbes are introduced in to a healthy
body , the body fights and kills
the invading bacteria  by producing
suitable antibodies. The antibodies
remain in the body and we are protected
In your childhood, you must have
been given injections to protect
yourself against several diseases.
Can you prepare a list of these
diseases? Y ou may take help fr om
your parents.
It is essential to protect all children
against these diseases. Necessary
vaccines are available in the nearby
hospitals. Y ou might have seen the
advertisement on TV and newspapers
regarding protection of children against
polio under the Pulse Polio Programme.
Polio drops given to children are
actually a vaccine.
A worldwide campaign against
smallpox has finally led to its eradication
from most parts of the world.
These days vaccines are made on a
large scale from microorganisms  to
protect humans and other animals from
several diseases.
Increasing Soil Fertility
Some bacteria  (Fig. 2.7) are able to fix
nitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich
soil with nitrogen and increase its
fertility. These microbes are commonly
called biological nitrogen fixers.

After some time , it decomposed and got
converted to manure. Boojho and
Paheli wanted to know how this had

Activity 2.5
Take two pots and fill each pot half
with soil. Mark them A and B. Put
plant waste in pot A and things like
polythene bags, empty glass bottles
and broken plastic toys in pot B.
Put the pots aside. Observe them
after 3-4 weeks.
Do you find any difference in the
contents of the two pots? If so, what is
the dif ference? Y ou will find that plant
waste  in pot A, has been decomposed.
How did this happen? The plant waste
has been converted into manure by the
action of microbes. The nutrientsreleased in the process can be used by
the plants again.
Did you notice that in pot B , the
polythene bags, empty glasses, bottles
and broken toy parts did not undergo
any such change? The microbes could
not ‘act’ on them and convert them into
manure.
You often see lar ge amounts of
dead organic matter in the form of
decaying plants and sometimes dead
animals on the gr
ound. You find
that they disappear after some time.
This is because the microorganisms
decompose dead organic waste of plants
and animals converting them into
simple substances. These substances
are again used by other plants and
animals.  Thus, microorganisms can
be used to degrade the harmful and
smelly substances and thereby clean
up the environment.
2.4Harmful Microorganisms
Microorganisms are harmful in many
ways. Some of the microorganisms
cause diseases in human beings, plants
and animals. Such disease-causingFig. 2.7 :  The Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (blue green algae)

microorganisms are called pathogens.
Some microorganisms spoil food,
clothing and leather . Let us study mor e
about their harmful activities.
Disease causing Microorganisms
in Humans
Pathogens enter our body through the
air we breathe, the water we drink or
the food we eat. They can also get
transmitted by direct contact with an
infected person or carried by an animal.
Microbial diseases that can spread from
an infected person to a healthy person
through air , water , food or physical
contact are called communicable
diseases . Examples of such diseases
include cholera, common cold, chicken
pox and tuberculosis.
When a person suffering from
common cold sneezes, fine droplets of
moisture carrying thousands of viruses
are spread in the air . The virus may enter
the body of a healthy person while
breathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals
which act as carriers  of disease-
causing microbes. Housefly is one such
carrier . The flies sit on the garbage and
animal excreta. Pathogens stick to their
bodies. When these flies sit on uncovered
food they may transfer the pathogens.
Whoever eats the contaminated food is
likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to
always keep food covered. Avoid
consuming uncovered items of food.
Another example of a carrier is the
female Anopheles  mosquito (Fig. 2.8),
which carries the parasite of malaria
(Plasmodium). Female Aedes  mosquito
acts as carrier of dengue virus.
How can we control the spread of malaria
or dengue?
Then how do you
prevent the spread of
communicable
diseases?
 We should keep a
handkerchief on the
nose and mouth while
sneezing. It is better to
keep a distance from
infected persons.

Why does the teacher
keep telling us not
to let water collect
anywhere in the
neighbourhood?
All mosquitoes br eed in water . Hence,
one should not let water collect
anywhere, in coolers, tyres, flower pot,
etc. By keeping the surroundings clean
and dry we can prevent mosquitoes from
breeding. T ry to make a list of measur es
which help to avoid the spread of
malaria.

use of certain chemicals which kill the
microbes.
Food Poisoning
Boojho was invited by his friend to a
party and he ate a variety of foodstuff.
On reaching home he started vomiting
and had to be taken to a hospital. The
doctor said that this condition could be
due to food poisoning.make the food poisonous causing
serious illness and even death. So, it
is very important that we preserve
food to prevent it from being spoilt.
2.5 Food Preservation
In Chapter 1, we have learnt about the
methods used to preserve and store food
grains. How do we preserve cooked  food
at home? Y ou know that br ead left
unused under moist conditions is
attacked by fungus. Microorganisms
spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad
smell and has a bad taste and changed
colour . Is spoiling of food a chemical
reaction?

SCIENCE 26Let us study the common methods
of pr eserving food in our homes. W e
have to save it from the attack of
microorganisms.
Chemical Method
Salts and edible oils are the common
chemicals generally used to check the
growth of microorganisms. Therefore
they ar e called preservatives
. We add
salt or acid preservatives to pickles to
prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium
benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are
common preservatives. These are also
used in jams and squashes to check
their spoilage .
Preservation by Common Salt
Common salt has been used to preserve
meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish
are covered with dry salt to check
the growth of bacteria. Salting is also
used to preserve amla, raw mangoes,
tamarind, etc.
Preservation by Sugar
Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved
by sugar . Sugar r educes the moistur e
content which inhibits the growth of
bacteria which spoil food.
Preservation by Oil and Vinegar
Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage
of pickles because bacteria cannot live
in such an envir onment. V egetables,
fruits, fish and meat are often preserved
by this method.
Heat and Cold Treatments
You must have observed your mother
boiling milk before it is stored or used.
Boiling kills many microorganisms.Similarly, we keep our food in the
refrigerator . Low temperatur e inhibits
the growth of microbes.
Pasteurised milk can be consumed
without boiling as it is free from harmful
microbes. The milk is heated to about
700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then
suddenly chilled and stored. By doing
so, it prevents the growth of microbes.
This process was discovered by Louis
Pasteur . It is called pasteurisation .
Storage and Packing
These days dry fruits and even
vegetables are sold in sealed air tight
packets to prevent the attack of
microbes.
2.6Nitrogen Fixation
You have lear nt about the bacterium
Rhizobium   in Classes VI and VII. It is
involved in the  fixation of nitrogen in
leguminous plants (pulses). Recall that
Rhizobium  lives in the root nodules of
leguminous plants  (Fig. 2.9), such as
beans and peas, with which it has a
symbiotic relationship. Sometimes
nitrogen gets fixed through the action
of lightning. But you know that the
amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere
remains constant. Y ou may wonder
how? Let us understand this in the next
section.
Why does the milk that
comes in packets not spoil?
My mother told me that the
milk is ‘pasteurised’. What
is pasteurisation?
2018-19


MICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 27nitrogen cannot be taken directly by
plants and animals. Certain bacteria and
blue green algae  present in the soil fix
nitrogen from the atmosphere and
convert it into compounds of nitrogen.
Once nitrogen is converted into these
usable compounds, it can be utilised by
plants from the soil through their root
system. Nitrogen is then used for the
synthesis of plant proteins and other
compounds. Animals feeding on plants
get these proteins and other nitrogen
compounds (Fig. 2.10).
When plants and animals die,
bacteria and fungi present in the soil
convert the nitrogenous wastes into
nitrogenous compounds to be used by
plants again. Certain other bacteria
convert some part of them to nitrogen
gas which goes back into the
atmosphere. As a result, the percentage
of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains
more or less constant.

SYNTHETIC  FIBRES AND PLASTICS SYNTHETIC  FIBRES AND PLASTICS
The clothes which we wear are
made of fabrics. Fabrics
are made from fibres obtained
from natural or artificial sources. Can
you name some natural fibres? Fibres
are also used for making a large variety
of household articles. Make a list of some
common articles made fr om fibr es. Try
to separate them into those made from
natural fibres and those made from
artificial fibres. Make entries in Table 3.1.
Why did you label some fibres as
artificial?
You have r ead in your pr evious
classes that natural fibres like cotton,
wool, silk, etc., are obtained from plants
or animals. The synthetic fibres, on the
other hand, are made by human beings.
That is why these are called synthetic
or man-made  fibres.3.1What are Synthetic
Fibres?
Try to r ecall the unifor m patter n found
in a necklace of beads joined with the
help of a thr ead [Fig. 3.1(a)]. Or , try to
join a number of paper clips together to
make a long chain, as in Fig. 3.1 (b). Is
there any similarity between the two?

Fibres
S. No. Name of Type of Fibre

artificial)
A synthetic fibre is also a chain of
small units joined together . Each small
unit is actually a chemical substance.
Many such small units combine to form
a large single unit called a polymer . The
word ‘polymer’ comes from two Greek
words; poly meaning many
 and mer
meaning part/unit. So,  a polymer is made
of many repeating units.
2018-19


Polymers occur in nature also. Cotton,
for example, is a polymer called
cellulose . Cellulose is made up of a
large number of glucose units.
3.2Types of Synthetic Fibres
Rayon
You have r ead in Class VII that silk fibr e
obtained from silkworm was discovered
in China and was kept as a closely
guarded secret for a long time. Fabric
obtained from silk fibre was very costly.
But its beautiful texture fascinated
everybody. Attempts were made to make
silk artificially. Towards the end of the
nineteenth century, scientists were
successful in obtaining a fibre having
properties similar to that of silk. Such a
fibre was obtained by chemical
treatment of wood pulp. This fibre was
called rayon or artificial silk .  Although
rayon is obtained from a natural source,
wood pulp, yet it is a man-made fibre. It
is cheaper than silk and can be woven
like silk fibres. It can also be dyed in a
wide variety of colours. Rayon is mixed
with cotton to make bed sheets or mixed
with wool to make carpets. (Fig. 3.2.)Nylon
Nylon  is another man-made fibre. In
1931, it was made without using any
natural raw material (from plant or
animal). It was prepared from coal, water
and air . It was the first fully synthetic
fibre.
Nylon fibre was strong, elastic and
light. It was lustrous and easy to wash.
So, it became very popular for making
clothes.
We use many articles made fr om
nylon, such as socks, ropes, tents,
toothbrushes, car seat belts, sleeping
bags, curtains, etc. (Fig. 3.3). Nylon is

Take an iron stand with a clamp.
Take a cotton thread of about 60
cm length. T ie it to the clamp so
that it hangs freely from it as shown
in Fig. 3.5. At the free end suspend
a pan so that weight can be placed
in it. Add weight one by one till the
thread breaks. Note down the total
weight required to break the thread.
This weight indicates the strength
of the fibre. Repeat the same activity
with thr eads of wool, polyester , silk
and nylon. Tabulate the data as
shown in Table 3.2. Arrange the
threads in order of their increasing
strength.

In place of weights you may
use marbles (or pebbles) of
similar size.
(Precaution : Note that all threads
should be of the same length and
almost of the same thickness. )
Polyester and Acrylic
Polyester is another synthetic fibre.
Fabric made from this fibre does not get
wrinkled easily. It remains crisp and is
easy to wash. So, it is quite suitable  for
making dr ess material. Y ou must have

Oh! Now I understand why
my mother never wears
polyester clothes while
working in the kitchen.PET (polyethylene terephthalate) is
a very familiar for m of polyester . It is
used for making bottles, utensils, films,
wires and many other useful products.
Look around and make a list of
things made of polyester .
Polyester (Poly+ester) is actually made
up of the repeating units of a chemical
called an ester . Esters ar e the
chemicals which give fruits their smell.
Fabrics are sold by names like polycot,
polywool, terrycot , etc. As the name
suggests, these are made by mixing two
types of fibres. Polycot is a mixture of
polyester and cotton. Polywool is a
mixture of polyester and wool.
We wear sweaters and use shawls
or blankets in the winter . Many of these
are actually not made from natural
wool, though they appear to resemble
wool. These are prepared from another
type of synthetic fibre called  acrylic
.
The wool obtained from natural
sources is quite expensive, whereas
clothes made from acrylic are relatively
cheap. They are available in a variety
of colours. Synthetic fibres are
more durable and affordable which
makes them more popular than
natural fibres.You have alr eady per formed an
activity of burning natural and
synthetic fibres (Activity 3.6 of Class
VII). What did you observe? When you
burn synthetic fibres you find that
their behaviour is different from
that of the natural fibres. Y ou must
have noticed that synthetic fibres
melt on heating. This is actually a
disadvantage of synthetic fibres. If the
clothes catch fire, it can be disastrous.
The fabric melts and sticks to the body
of the person wearing it. W e should,
therefore, not wear synthetic clothes
while working in in the kitchen or in
a laboratory.
All the synthetic fibres are prepared
by a number of processes using raw
materials of petroleum origin, called
petrochemicals .
3.3Characteristics of
Synthetic Fibres
Imagine that it is a rainy day. What kind
of umbrella would you use and why?
Synthetic fibres possess unique
characteristics which make them

3.4 Plastics
You must be familiar with many plastic
articles used everyday. Make a list of
such items and their uses.Plastic is also a polymer like the
synthetic fibre. All plastics do not
have the same type of arrangement of
units. In some it is linear , whereas in
others it is cross-linked. (Fig. 3.6).
Plastic articles are available in all
possible shapes and sizes as you can
see in Fig. 3.7. Have you ever
wondered how this is possible? The
fact is that plastic is easily mouldable
i.e. can be shaped in any form. Plastic
can be recycled, reused, coloured,
melted, rolled into sheets or made into
wires. That is why it find s such a
variety of uses.
Polythene  (Poly+ethene) is an example
of a plastic. It is used for making
commonly used polythene bags.

3.5Plastics as Materials of
Choice
Today if we  think of storing a food
item, water , milk, pickles, dry food
etc., plastic containers seem most
convenient. This is because of their
light weight, lower price, good strength
and easy handling. Being lighter as
compared to metals, plastics are used
in cars, aircrafts and spacecrafts, too.
The list is endless if we start counting
articles like slippers, furniture,
decoration pieces , etc.
Now, let us discuss the characteristic
properties of plastics.
Plastic is Non-reactive
You know that metals like ir on get
rusted when left exposed to moisture
and air . But plastics do not r
eact with
water and air .  They ar e not corroded
easily. That is why they are used to store
various kinds of material, including
many chemicals.
Plastic is Light, Strong and Durable
Talk to your parents or grandparents
about the types of buckets that were
used in the past. What is the material
of the buckets or mugs you are using
today? What are the advantages of using
a plastic container? Since plastic is very
light, strong, durable and can be
moulded into different shapes and sizes,
it is used for various purposes. Plastics
are generally cheaper than metals. They
are widely used in industry and for
household articles. Make a list of
different kinds of plastic containers that
you use in daily life.add hot water to a plastic bottle, it gets
deformed. Such plastic which
gets deformed easily on heating and
can be bent easily are known as
thermoplastics. Polythene and PVC are
some of the examples of thermoplastics.
These are used for manufacturing toys,
combs and various types of containers.
On the other hand, there are some
plastics which when moulded once, can
not be softened by heating. These are
called thermosetting  plastics.  Two
examples are bakelite and melamine.
Bakelite is a poor conductor of heat and
electricity. It is used for making
electrical switches, handles of various
utensils, etc. Melamine is a versatile
material. It resists fire and can tolerate
heat better than other plastics. It is used
for making floor tiles, kitchenware and
fabrics which resist fire. Fig. 3.8 shows
the various uses of thermoplastics and
thermosetting plastics.

3.6Plastics and the
Environment
When we go to the market, we usually
get things wrapped in plastic or packed
in polythene bags. That is one reason
why plastic waste keeps getting
accumulated in our homes. Ultimately,
plastic finds its way to the garbage.
Disposal of plastic is a major problem.
Why?
A material which gets decomposed
through natural processes, such
as action by bacteria, is called
biodegradable
. A material which is not
easily decomposed by natural processes
is termed non-biodegradable.
Look at Table 3.3.

poisonous fumes into the atmosphere
causing air pollution. How can this
problem be solved?Avoid the use of plastics as far as
possible. Make use of bags made of
cotton or jute when you go for shopping.
The biodegradable and non-
biodegradable wastes should be
collected separately and disposed off
separately. Practise this in your homes.
Can you suggest some other ways in
which you can contribute towards
reducing the use of plastic materials?
It is better to recycle plastic waste.
Most of the thermoplastics can be
recycled. Make a list of items that can
be recycled. However , during r ecycling
certain colouring agents are added.
This limits its usage especially for
storage of food.
As a responsible citizen remember
the 5 R principle. Reduce, Reuse,
Recycle,  Recover and Refuse . Develop
habits which are environment friendly.
Fibre-wise
/circlerightDo not throw plastic bags in the
water bodies or on the road.
/circlerightTake a cotton carry bag or a jute
bag while going for shopping.
/circlerightTry to minimise the use of plastic
materials e.g., use a steel lunch
box instead of a plastic one.Have you ever seen a garbage dump
where animals are eating garbage?  In
the process of eating the food waste
they swallow materials like polythene
bags and wrappers of food. Can you
imagine the consequences? The
plastic material chokes the respiratory
system of these animals, or forms a
lining in their stomachs and can be
the cause of their death.
The polybags carelessly thrown here
and there are responsible for clogging
the drains, too. Sometimes we are very
careless and throw the wrappers of
chips, biscuits and other eatables on
the road or in parks or picnic places.
Should we not think twice before doing
so ? As a responsible citizen what
measures do you suggest to keep public
places clean and free of plastic?

/circlerightSynthetic fibres and plastics, like natural fi-
bres, are made of very large units called poly-
mers. Polymers are made up of many smaller
units.
/circlerightWhile natural fibres are obtained from plants
and animals, synthetic fibres are obtained by
chemical processing of petrochemicals.  Like
natural fibres, these fibres can also be woven
into fabrics.
/circlerightSynthetic fibres find uses ranging from
many household articles like ropes,
buckets, furniture, containers, etc., to highly
specialised uses in aircrafts, ships, space-
crafts, healthcare, etc.
/circlerightDepending upon the types of chemicals used
for manufacturing synthetic fibres, they are
called Rayon, Nylon, Polyester and Acrylic.
/circlerightThe different types of fibres differ from one
another in their strength, water absorbing
capacity, nature of burning, cost, durability
etc.

Be it home, or outside, plastic is everywhere.
/circlerightThe waste created by plastics is not
environment friendly. On burning, plastics
release poisonous gases. On dumping in the
ground they may take years to degenerate.
This is because of their non-biodegradable
nature.

Fig. 4.2 : Electric testerWhere do you find the use of
aluminium and copper wires? Have you
seen wires of coal ? Definitely not!
The property of metal by which it can
be drawn into wires is called ductility.
Have you ever noticed the difference
in sound on dropping an iron sheet/plate, a metal coin, and a piece of coal
on the floor? If not, you can try it now.
Do you note any difference in the sound
produced?Oh! The meaning of recalling
our experiences and then of
this activity was to show that
metals are good conductors of
heat and electricity. W e lear nt
this in Class VI.
MATERIALS  : M ETALS AND NON-METALS 45You saw that the shape of the ir on nail
and the aluminium wire changed on
beating. If they were beaten harder thesecould be changed into sheets. Y ou might
be familiar with silver foil used fordecorating sweets. You must also befamiliar with the aluminium foil used forwrapping food. The property of metals bywhich they can be beaten into thin sheetsis called malleability . This is a
characteristic property of metals. As youmust have noticed, materials like coal andpencil lead do not show this property. Canwe call these metals?
Can you hold a hot metallic pan which
is without a plastic or a wooden handleand not get hurt? Per haps not! Why? Try
to list some other experiences in which awooden or plastic handle protects youfrom being hurt while handling hotthings. On the basis of these experienceswhat can you say about the conductionof heat by wood and plastic?
You must have seen an electrician
using his scr ew driver . What kind of
handle does it have? Why?
Let us find out.

SCIENCE 46
Have you seen wooden bells in
temples? Can you give a reason?
The things made of metals produce
a ringing sound when struck hard.
Suppose you have two boxes similar inappearance, one made of wood and theother of metal. Can you tell which boxis made of metal by striking both theboxes?
Since metals produce ringing
sounds, they are said to be sonorous.
The materials other than metals are notsonorous.
After per forming the above activities,
we can say that some materials are hard,
lustrous, malleable, ductile, sonorousand good conductors of heat andelectricity.  The materials which
generally possess these properties arecalled metals. The examples of metalsare iron, copper, aluminium, calcium,
magnesium, etc. In contrast, materialslike coal and sulphur are soft and dullin appearance. They break down into  apowdery mass on tapping with ahammer . They ar e not sonor ous and ar e
poor conductors of heat and electricity.These materials are called non-metals.
The examples of non-metals ar e sulphur ,
carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, etc.which rust is for med. Y ou had also
perfor med  in Class VII an activity of
burning a magnesium ribbon in air . You
had learnt that in both the processesoxide formation takes place. Completethe following reactions of iron andmagnesium with oxygen.
Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O

Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (O2)  → ?
Activity 4.3
Let us check the nature of rust
formed as a result of the reactionbetween iron, oxygen and water .
Collect a spoonful of rust anddissolve it in a very little  amount ofwater . You will find that the rust
remains suspended in water . Shake
the suspension well. Test thesolution with red and blue litmuspapers (Fig. 4.3). What do youobserve? Is the solution acidic orbasic?
Metals like sodium and potassium aresoft and can be cut with a knife.Mercury is the only metal which isfound in liquid state at room

Is the solution acidic or basic? How

You must have observed that the red
litmus turns blue. So, oxide of magnesiumis also basic in nature. In general, metallicoxides are basic in nature.
Let us now observe the reaction of
non-metals with oxygen.
Activity 4.4
(To be demonstrated by the teacherin the class)
Take a small amount of powdered
sulphur in a deflagrating spoon andheat it. If deflagrating spoon is notavailable, you may take a metallic capof any bottle and wrap a metallic wirearound it and give it the shape
shown in Fig. 4.4 (a).As soon as sulphur starts burning,introduce the spoon into a gas jar/glass tumbler [ Fig. 4.4  (a)]. Cover the
tumbler with a lid to ensure thatthe gas produced does not escape.Remove the spoon after some time.Add a small quantity of water intothe tumbler and quickly replace thelid. Shake the tumbler well. Checkthe solution with red and bluelitmus papers [Fig. 4.4 (b)].

During demonstration special care
should be taken that the size of the
sodium metal piece is roughly the size
of a wheat grain. It should be held
with a pair of tongs. )
Take a 250 mL beaker/glass tumbler .

MATERIALS  : M ETALS AND NON-METALS 49You observed that sodium r eacts
vigor ously with water. Some other metals
do not do so. For example, iron reacts
with water slowly.
Generally, non-metals do not react
with water though they may be veryreactive in air . Such non-metals ar e
stored in water. For example,
Activity 4.6
(War ning : Keep the mouth of the test tube away from your face. Use test tube
holder to hold the test tube.)
Take samples of metals and non-metals listed in Table 4.5 in separate test
tubes and label them as A, B, C, D, E, and F . With the help of a dropper  add 5
mL of dilute hydrochloric acid to each test tube one by one. Observe thereactions carefully. If no reaction occurs in the cold solution, warm the test
tube gently. Bring a burning matchstick near the mouth of each test tube.
Repeat the same activity using  dilute sulphuric acid instead of the dilute
hydrochloric acid. Record your observations in Table 4.5.

Reactions with Acids
Let us see how metals and non-metals
behave with acids.
2018-19


SCIENCE 50Is there a difference in the way metals
and non-metals react with acids? What
could the ‘pop’ sound in some cases bedue to when a burning match stick isbrought near the mouth of the test tubes?
You must have found that non-
metals generally do not react with acidsbut metals react with acids and producehydrogen gas that burns with a ‘pop’sound. Y ou must have noticed that
copper does not react with dilutehydrochloric acid even on heating butit reacts with sulphuric acid.
Reactions with Bases
Activity 4.7
(To be demonstrated by the teacher .
During the preparation of sodium
hydroxide solution, care should betaken that pellets of sodium hydroxideare handled with a plastic spatula).
Prepare a fresh solution of sodium
hydroxide in a test tube bydissolving 3-4 pellets of it in 5 mLof water. Drop a piece of aluminiumfoil into it. Bring a burning matchstick near the mouth of the test
tube. Observe carefully.
What does the ‘pop’ sound indicate?
As before, the ‘pop’ sound indicates the
presence of hydrogen gas.
Metals react with sodium hydroxide
to produce hydrogen gas.
Reactions of non-metals with bases
are complex.

copper sulphate and iron that youperfor med in Class VII. Let us observe
some more reactions of that kind.

based on facts. And the rule here isthat zinc is more reactive than copperand iron. A more reactive metal canreplace a less reactive metal, but a lessreactive one cannot replace a morereactive metal. Now you canunderstand why there are nodisplacement reactions in beakers Dand E also. Can you guess thesequence of metals from more reactiveto less reactive among zinc, iron andcopper?
4.3 Uses of Metals and
Non-metals
You should be able to guess why metalsare used in making machinery,automobiles, aeroplanes, trains,satellites, industrial gadgets, cookingutensils, water boilers, etc. You are alsofamiliar with the uses of some non-metals. Here are some interesting ones.We are sur e that you will guess them
right:
Non-metal is essential for our lifewhich all living beings inhale duringbreathing,
Non-metals used in fertilisers toenhance the growth of plants,
Non-metal used in water purificationprocess,
Non-metal used in the purplecoloured solution which is appliedon wounds as an antiseptic,
Non-metals used in crackers.
You may add some mor e uses of
metals and non-metals from  your
experiences.What changes do you observe in the
various beakers? Y ou have r ead that one
metal displaces another metal from its
compound in aqueous solution. Inbeaker ‘A’ zinc (Zn) replaces copper (Cu)
from copper sulphate (CuSO
4). That is
why the blue colour of copper sulphate
disappears and a powdery red mass ofcopper is deposited at the bottom of thebeaker . The r eaction can be represented
as follows:
Copper Sulphate (CuSO
4) + Zinc (Zn)
             (Blue)
→ Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4) + Copper (Cu)
(Colourless)                      (Red)
You can write down the r eaction
taking place in beaker ‘B’ in a similar
manner.
I have understood the reactions
taking place in beakers ‘A’ and
‘B’. But I am still confused why
there is no change in  beakers
‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘E’?
There could have been displacement
of zinc by copper in beaker ‘C’ and by
iron in beaker ‘E’. Similarly iron could
be displaced by copper in beaker ‘D’.
Since we do not see any change in
beaker C, we can infer that copper is
not able to replace zinc from zincsulphate.  But why? When zinc canreplace copper in beaker ‘A’ why
cannot copper replace zinc in beaker‘C’? Remember that science is not

In Class VII, you have learnt that in a chemical reaction, new substances are
formed. These substances are different from those which underwent the reaction.Now, if a substance cannot be broken down further by chemical reactions, bycooling, heating, or by electrolysis, it is called ‘element’. Sulphur is an element.So is iron. Carbon, too, is an element. The smallest unit of an element is atom. Asample of an element contains only one kind of atom. The atom of an elementremains unaffected by physical changes in the element. For example, an atom ofliquid sulphur would be exactly the same as the atom of solid or vapour sulphur.
Although we have an infinite variety of substances in the universe, the number
of elements forming these substances is limited. There are no more than 94naturally occurring elements. An important classification of elements is in termsof metals and non-metals. Most of the elements are metals. The remaining areeither non-metals or metalloids. Metalloids possess character of both metals and
non-metals.

(i) Inexhaustible Natural Resources:
These resources are present in unlimited
quantity in nature and are not likely to

human activities. Examples of these
resources are forests, wildlife, minerals,
coal, petroleum, natural gas etc.
Activity 5.2
(It is a group activity)
Take some containers. Fill them
with  popcorn/peanuts/roasted
gram/toffees. Divide students into
groups of seven each. Further divide
each group into three subgroups
containing 1, 2 and 4 students.
Label them as first, second
and third generation respectively.We use various materials for our
basic needs. Some of them are
found in nature and some
have been made by human efforts.
Activity 5.1
Make a list of various materials used
by us in daily life and classify them
as natural and man-made.
Natural Man-made
Can we use all our
natural resources
forever ?
Does this list include air , water , soil
and minerals? Since all these are
obtained from nature, they are called
natural resources.
2018-19


These sub-groups represent the
consumers. As population is
growing, second and third
generations have larger number of
consumers.
Put one full container for each
group on a table. Ask consumers of
the first generation from each group
to consume eatables from the
container of their group. Now, ask
the second generation consumers
from each group to do the same. Ask
students to observe carefully the
availability of eatables in each
container . If some thing is left in the
containers, ask third generation
from each group to consume it. Now,
finally observe whether all the
consumers of the third generation
got the eatables or not. Also observe
if anything is still left in any of the
containers.
Assume that the eatables in the
container represent the total
availability of an exhausible natural
resource like coal, petroleum or
natural gas. Each group may have a
different consumption pattern. Are
the earlier generations of any group
too greedy?  It may be that the earlier
generations in some groups were
concerned about the coming
generation(s)  and left something for
them.
In this chapter we will learn about
some exhaustible natural resources
like coal, petroleum and natural gas.
These were formed from the dead
remains of living organisms (fossils).
So, these are all known as fossil
fuels.5.1 Coal
You may have seen coal or hear d about
it (Fig. 5.1). It is as hard as stone and is
black in colour .
Fig. 5.1: Coal
Coal is one of the fuels used 
to cook
food. Earlier , it was used in railway
engines to produce steam to run the
engine. It is also used in thermal power
plants to produce electricity. Coal is also
used as a fuel in various industries.
Story of Coal
Where do we get
coal from and how
is it formed?
About 300 million years ago the
earth had dense forests in low lying
wetland areas. Due to natural processes,
like flooding, these forests got buried
under the soil. As more soil deposited
over them, they were compressed. The
temperature also rose as they sank
deeper and deeper . Under high pr essur e
and high temperature, dead plants got
slowly converted to coal. As coal
contains mainly carbon, the slow
process of conversion of dead vegetation
into coal is called carbonisation. Since
it was formed from the remains of
vegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel.
A coal mine is shown in Fig. 5.2.

Coal Gas
Coal gas is obtained during the
processing of coal to get coke. It is used
Coal gas was used for street lighting
for the first time in London in 1810
and in New Y ork ar ound 1820. Now a
days, it is used as a source of heat
rather than light.These days, bitumen, a petroleum
product, is used in place of coal-tar
for metalling the roads.
Fig. 5.3:  Coal tarWhen heated in air , coal bur ns and
produces mainly carbon dioxide gas.
Coal is processed in industry to get
some useful products such as coke, coal
tar and coal gas.
Coke
It is a tough, porous and black
substance. It is an almost pure form of
carbon. Coke is used in the manufacture
of steel and in the extraction of many
metals.
Coal Tar
It is a black, thick liquid (Fig. 5.3) with
an unpleasant smell. It is a mixture ofabout 200 substances. Products
obtained from coal tar are used as
starting materials for manufacturing
various substances used in everyday
life and in industry, like synthetic
dyes, drugs, explosives, per fumes,
plastics, paints, photographic materials,
roofing materials, etc. Interestingly,
naphthalene balls used to repel moths
and other insects are also obtained from
coal tar .

COAL AND PETROLEUM 59as a fuel in many industries situated
near the coal processing plants.
5.2 Petroleum
You know that petr ol is used as a fuel in
light automobiles such as motor cycles/
scooters and cars. Heavy motor vehicles
like trucks and tractors run on diesel.
Petrol and diesel are obtained from a
natural resource called petroleum.  The
word petroleum is derived from petra
(rock) and oleum (oil) as it is mined
from between the rocks under Earth as
shown in Fig. 5.4.
Do you know how petroleum is
formed?
Petroleum was formed from
organisms living in the sea. As these
organisms died, their bodies settled at
the bottom of the sea and got covered
with layers of sand and clay. Over
millions of years, absence of air , high
temperature and high pressureRefining of Petroleum
Petroleum is a dark oily liquid. It has
an unpleasant odour . It is a mixtur e of
various constituents such as petroleum
gas, petrol, diesel, lubricating oil,
paraffin wax, etc. The process of
Fig. 5.4 :  Petroleum and natural gas depositsThe world’s first oil well was drilled
in Pennsylvania, USA, in 1859. Eight
years later , in 1867, oil was struck
at Makum in Assam. In India, oil is
found in Assam, Gujarat, Mumbai
High and in the river basins of
Godavari and Krishna.transformed the dead organisms into
petroleum and natural gas.
Look at Fig. 5.4. It shows the deposits
of petr oleum and natural gas. Y ou see
that the layer containing petroleum oil
and gas is above that of water . Why is it
so? Recall that oil and gas are lighter
than water and do not mix with it.

SCIENCE 60separating the various constituents/
fractions of petroleum is known as
refining. It is carried out in a petroleum
refinery  (Fig. 5.5).Various constituents of petr oleum
and their uses are given in Table 5.1.
Many useful substances are obtained
from petroleum and natural gas.
These are termed as ‘Petrochemicals’.
These are used in the manufacture
of deter gents, fibr es (polyester , nylon,
acrylic etc.), polythene and other
man-made plastics. Hydrogen gas
obtained from natural gas, is used in
the production of fertilisers (urea).
Due to its great commercial
importance, petroleum is also called
‘black gold’.
5.3 Natural Gas
Natural gas is a very important fossil
fuel because it is easy to transport
through pipes. Natural gas is stored
under high pressure as compressed
natural gas (CNG). CNG is used for
power generation. It is now being used

COAL AND PETROLEUM 61as a fuel for transport vehicles because
it is less polluting. It is a cleaner fuel.
The great advantage of CNG is that
it can be used directly for burning in
homes and factories where it can be
supplied through pipes. Such a network
of pipelines exists in V adodara (Gujarat),
some parts of Delhi and other places.
Natural gas is also used as a starting
material for the manufacture of a number
of chemicals and fertilisers. India has vast
reserves of natural gas. In our country,
natural gas has been found in T ripura,
Rajasthan, Maharashtra and in the
Krishna Godavari delta.5.4Some Natural Resources
are Limited
You have studied in the beginning of
the chapter that some natural resources
are exhaustible like fossil fuels, forests,
minerals etc.
You know that coal and petr oleum
are fossil fuels. It required the dead
organisms millions of years to get
converted into these fuels. On the
other hand, the known reserves of
these will last only a few hundred
years. Mor eover , bur ning of these
fuels is a major cause of air pollution.
Their use is also linked to global
warming. It is therefore necessary that
we use these fuels only when
absolutely necessary. This will result
in better environment, smaller risk of
global warming and their availability
for a longer period of time.
In India, the Petroleum Conservation
Research Association (PCRA) advises
people how to save petrol/diesel while
driving. Their tips are
/circle6drive at a constant and moderate
speed as far as possible,
/circle6switch off the engine at traffic lights
or at a place where you have to wait,
/circle6ensure correct tyre pressure.
/circle6ensure regular maintenance of the
vehicle.Can coal, petroleum
and natural gas be
prepared in the
laboratory from dead
organisms?
No. Their
formation is a very
slow process and
conditions for
their formation
cannot be created
in the laboratory.

COMBUSTION  AND FLAME COMBUSTION  AND FLAME
We use dif fer
ent kinds of fuel for
various purposes at home, in
industry and for running
automobiles. Can you name a few fuels
used in our homes? Name a few fuels
used in trade and industry. What fuels
are used for running automobiles? Y our
list will contain fuels like cowdung,
wood, coal, charcoal, petrol, diesel,
compressed natural gas (CNG), etc.
You ar e familiar with the bur ning of a
candle. What is the difference between the
burning of a candle and the burning of a
fuel like coal? May be you were able to
guess right: candle burns with a flame
whereas coal does not. Similarly, you will
find many other materials burning
without a flame. Let us study the chemical
process of burning and the types of flame
produced during this process.
6.1 What is Combustion?
Recall the activity of burning of
magnesium ribbon per formed in
Class VII. W e lear nt that magnesium
burns to form magnesium oxide and
produces heat and light (Fig. 6.1).
We can per form a similar activity with
a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with
a pair of tongs and bring it near the
flame of a candle or a  Bunsen bur ner.
What do you observe?
We find that char coal bur ns in air .
We know that coal, too, bur ns  in air
producing carbon dioxide, heat and
light.We wer e told that
food is a fuel for
our body.
Fig. 6.1 : Burning of magnesium
A chemical process in which a
substance reacts with oxygen to give
off heat is called combustion . The
substance that undergoes combustion
is said to be combustible. It is also called
a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or
gas. Sometimes, light is also given off
during combustion, either as a flame or
as a glow.
In the reactions mentioned
above magnesium and charcoal are
combustible substances.

burning candle).

a glass chimney over the candle and
rest it on a few wooden blocks in
such a way that air can enter the

Rightly so. In our body
food is broken down by
reaction with oxygen and
heat is pr oduced. W e
learnt that in Class VII.
Can you name some more
substances which ar e combustible? Y ou
can add  those to Table 6.1.
Let us investigate conditions under
which combustion takes place.
COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 65chimney [Fig. 6.2(a)]. Observe what
happens to the flame. Now remove
the blocks and let the chimney rest
on the table [Fig. 6.2(b)]. Again
observe the flame. Finally, put a
glass plate over the chimney [Fig.
6.2(c)]. W atch the flame again. What
happens in the three cases? Does
the flame flicker off? Does it flicker
and give  smoke? Does it burn
unaffected? Can you infer anything
at all about the role played by air in
the process of burning?
We find that for combustion, air is
necessary. The candle burns freely in
case (a) when air can enter the
chimney from below. In case (b), when
air does not enter the chimney from
below, the flame flickers and produces
smoke. In case (c), the flame finally
goes off because the air is not
available.

SCIENCE 66Activity  6.3
Place a piece of burning wood or
charcoal on an iron plate or Tawa
.
Cover it with a glass jar or a
tumbler , or a transparent plastic jar .
Observe what happens. Does
charcoal stop burning after
sometime? Can you think of the
reason why it stops burning?
You might have hear d that when the
clothes of a person catch fire, the personWe have r ead that the sun
produces its own heat and
light. Is it also some kind of
combustion?
In the sun, heat and light are
produced by nuclear r eactions. Y ou
will learn about this process in higher
classes.
During extreme heat
of summer , at some
places dry grass
catches fire. From
the grass, it spreads
to trees, and very
soon the whole forest
is on fire (Fig. 6.4). It
is very difficult to
control such fires.
Fig. 6.4 : Forest fireFig. 6.3 : Blanket wrapped around a person
whose clothes caught fire
Now recall some of your experiences.
Does a matchstick burn by itself?
How does it burn?
You must have had an experience of
burning a piece of paper . Does it bur n
when a burning matchstick is brought
near it?
Can you burn a piece of wood by
bringing a lighted matchstick near it?
Why do you have to use paper or
kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal?
Have you heard of forest fires?is covered with a blanket to extinguish
fire (Fig. 6.3). Can you guess why?
2018-19


COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 67We find that a combustible substance
cannot catch fire or burn as long as its
temperature is lower than its ignition
temperature. Have you ever seen
cooking oil catching fire when a frying
pan is kept for long on a burning stove?
Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire
on their own at room temperature. But,
if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will
catch fire. But if wood is heated a little,
it would still not catch fire. Does it mean
that ignition temperature of kerosene oil
is lower than that of wood? Does it mean
that we need to take special care in
storing kerosene oil? The following
activity shows that it is essential for a
substance to reach ignition temperature
to burn.
Activity 6.4
(Caution : Be careful while handling
burning candle).
Make two paper cups by folding a
sheet of paper . Pour about 50 mL of
water in one of the cups. Heat both
the cups separately with a candle
(Fig. 6.5). What do you observe?The history of the matchstick is very
old. More than five thousand years
ago small pieces of pinewood dipped
in sulphur were used as matches in
ancient Egypt. The modern safety
match was developed only about two
hundred years ago.
A mixture of antimony trisulphide,
potassium chlorate and white
phosphorus with some glue and
starch was applied on the head of a
match made of suitable wood. When
struck against a rough surface, white
phosphorus got ignited due to the heat
of friction. This started the
combustion of the match. However ,
white phosphorus proved to be
dangerous both for the workers
involved in the manufacturing of
matches and for the users.
These days the head of the safety
match contains only antimony
trisulphide and potassium chlorate.
The rubbing surface has powdered
glass and a little red phosphorus
(which is much less dangerous).
When the match is struck against
the rubbing surface, some red
phosphorus gets converted into white
phosphorus. This immediately reacts
with potassium chlorate in the
matchstick head to produce enough
heat to ignite antimony trisulphide
and start the combustion.Do these experiences tell you that
different substances catch fire at
different temperatures?
The lowest temperature at which a
substance catches fire is called its
ignition temperature.
Can you tell now why a matchstick
does not catch fire on its own at room
temperature? Why does the matchstick
start burning on rubbing it on the side
of the matchbox?

What happens to the empty paper
cup? What happens to the paper cup
with water? Does water in this cup
become hot?
2018-19


SCIENCE 68If we continue heating
the cup, we can even boil
water in the paper cup.
Can you think of an
explanation for this
phenomenon?
The heat supplied to
the paper cup is
transferred to water by
conduction. So, in the
presence of water , the
ignition temperature of
paper is not reached.
Hence, it does not burn.
The substances which
have very low ignition
temperature and can
easily catch fire with
a flame are called
inflammable substances . Examples of
inflammable substances are petrol,
alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)
etc. Can you list some more inflammable
substances?
6.2How Do W e Contr ol Fir e?
You must have seen or hear d of fir e
breaking out in homes, shops and
factories. If you have seen such an
accident, write a short description in
your note book. Also, share the
experience with your classmates.
It is important that all of us
know the telephone numbers
of the fire service.Fig. 6.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure
Find out the telephone number of the
fire service in your area. If a fire
breaks out in your house or in your
neighbourhood, the first thing to do
is to call the fire service.Does your city/town have a fire
brigade station?
When a fire brigade arrives, what
does it do? It pours water on the fire
(Fig. 6.6). W ater cools the combustible
material so that its temperature is
brought below its ignition
temperature. This prevents the fire
from spr eading. W ater vapour s also
surround the combustible material,
helping in cutting of f the supply of air .
So, the fire is extinguished.
You have lear
nt that ther e are three
essential requirements for producing
fire. Can you list these requirements?
These are: fuel, air (to supply
oxygen) and heat (to raise the
temperature of the fuel beyond the
ignition temperature). Fire can be
controlled by removing one or more of
these requirements. The job of a fire
extinguisher is to cut off the supply of
air, or to bring down the temperatur e
of the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel
2018-19


COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 69The most common fire
extinguisher is water . But
water works only when
things like wood and paper
are on fire. If electrical
equipment is on fire, water
may conduct electricity
and harm those trying to
douse the fir e. W ater is
also not suitable for fires
involving oil and petrol. Do
you recall that water is
heavier than oil? So, it
sinks below the oil, and oil
keeps burning on the top.
For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like
petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than
oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and
oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in
most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.
How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure
as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When
released fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down.
So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the
temperatur
e of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another
way to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium
bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these
chemicals give off CO2.
CAUTION  : Do not handle the gas
stove yourself. Ask your parents
to help.
Fig. 6.7 :  Fire extinguisher
in most cases cannot be  eliminated.
If, for instance, a building catches fire,
the whole building is the fuel.
6.3Types of Combustion
Bring a burning matchstick or a gas
lighter near a gas stove in the kitchen.
Turn on the knob of the gas stove. What
do you observe?We find that the gas bur ns rapidly
and produces heat and light. Such
combustion is known as 
rapid
combustion .
There are substances like
phosphorus which burn in air at room
temperature.
The type of combustion in which
a material suddenly bursts into
flames, without the application of any
apparent cause is called spontaneous
combustion.
2018-19


SCIENCE 70
Spontaneous combustion of coal dust
has resulted in many disastrous fires
in coal mines. Spontaneous forest
fires are sometimes due to the heat
of the sun or due to lightning strike.
However , most for est fir es ar e due to
the carelessness of human beings. It
is important to remember that the
campfires must be completely
extinguished before leaving a forest
after a picnic, or a visit.
We generally have fir eworks on
festival days. When a cracker is ignited,
a sudden reaction takes place with the
evolution of heat, light and sound. A
large amount of gas formed in the
reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is
called explosion.  Explosion can also take
place if pressure is applied on the
cracker .
6.4Flame
Observe an LPG flame. Can you tell the
colour of the flame. What is the colour
of a candle flame?
Recall your experience of burning a
magnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you
do not have experience of burning the

Light a candle (Caution : Be careful).
Hold a 4 -5 cm long thin glass tube
with a pair of tongs and introduce
its one end in the dark zone of a
non-flickering candle flame (Fig.
6.10). Bring a lighted matchstick
near the other end of the glass tube.
Do you see a flame caught at this
end of the glass tube after a while?
If so, what is it that produces a
flame? Notice that the wax near the
heated wick melts quickly.
The substances which vapourise
during burning, give flames. For
example, kerosene oil and molten wax
rise through the wick and are vapourised
during burning and form flames.
Charcoal, on the other hand, does not
vapourise and so does not produce a
flame. In Activity 6. 5, could the vapours
of wax coming out of the glass tube be
the cause of the flame produced?

Fig. 6.14 : Goldsmith blowing through a
metallic pipe6.6What is a Fuel?
Recall that the sources of heat energy
for domestic and industrial purposes
are mainly wood, charcoal, petrol,
kerosene etc. These substances are
called fuels. 
A good fuel is one which is
readily available. It is cheap. It burns
easily in air at a moderate rate. It
produces a large amount of heat. It does
not leave behind any undersirable
substances.
There is probably no fuel that could
be consider ed as an ideal fuel . We
should look for a fuel which fulfils most
of the requirements for a particular use.
Fuels differ in their cost. Some fuels
are cheaper than others.
Make a list of fuels familiar to you.
Group them as solid, liquid and gaseous
fuels as in Table 6.3.
6.7Fuel Efficiency
Suppose you were asked to boil a given
quantity of water using cow dung, coal
and LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you
prefer? Give your reason. Y ou may take
the help of your parents. Do these three
fuels produce the same amount of heat?
The amount of heat energy produced on
complete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is
called its calorific value. The calorific
value of a fuel is expressed in a unitFig. 6.13 : Different zones of candle flame

particles. These fine particles are
dangerous pollutants causing
respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
2.Incomplete combustion of these
fuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a
very poisonous gas. It is dangerous to
burn coal in a closed room. The carbon
monoxide gas produced can kill persons
sleeping in that room.
For centuries, wood was used as
domestic and industrial fuel. But now
it has been replaced by coal and other
fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of
our country, people still use wood as a
fuel because of its easy availability and
low cost. However , burning of wood gives
a lot of smoke which is very harmful for
human beings. It causes respiratory
problem. Also, trees provide us with
useful substances which are lost when
wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting
of trees leads to deforestation  which is
quite harmful to the environment, as
you learnt in Class VII.Table 6.4 : Calorific V alues of dif ferent

Oh! So, that is why we are

Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful
Products
The increasing fuel consumption has
harmful effects on the environment.
1.Carbon fuels like wood, coal,
petroleum release unburnt carbon3.Combustion of most fuels releases
carbon dioxide in the environment.
Increased concentration of carbon
dioxide in the air is believed to cause
global warming .
Global warming is the rise in
temperature of the atmosphere  of the
earth. This results , among other things,
in the melting of polar glaciers , which
leads to a rise in the sea level, causing
floods in the coastal areas . Low lying
coastal areas may even be permanently
submer ged under water .
4.Burni ng of coal and diesel releases
sulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely
suffocating and corr osive gas. Mor eover ,
petrol engines give off  gaseous oxides of
nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen
dissolve in rain water and form acids.
Such rain is called acid rain . It is very
harmful for cr ops, buildings and soil. Y ou
have already learnt about it in Class VII.
The use of diesel and petrol as fuels
in automobiles is being replaced by
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because
CNG produces the harmful  products in
very small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.called  kilojoule per kg  (kJ/kg).
Calorific values of some fuels are given

We saw in Class VII that
Paheli  and  Boojho  had visited
the forest along with Professor
Ahmad and T ibu. They wer e eager to
share their experiences with their
classmates. Other children in the class
were also eager to share their experiences
as some of them had visited Bharatpur
Sanctuary. Some others had heard
about  Kaziranga National Park,
Lockchao Wildlife Sanctuary, Great
Nicobar Biospher e Reserve and T iger
Reserve, etc.Some natural causes of deforestation
are forest fires and severe droughts.
Activity 7.1
Add more causes of deforestation to
your list and classify them into
natural and man-made.
7.2Consequences of
Deforestation
Paheli and Boojho recalled the
consequences of deforestation. They
remembered that deforestation increases
the temperature and pollution level on
the earth. It increases the level of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Ground water
level also gets lowered. They know that
deforestation disturbs the balance in
nature. They were told by Professor
Ahmad that if cutting of trees continues,

7.1 Deforestation and Its
Causes
A great variety of plants and animals
exist on earth. They are essential for the
well-being and survival of mankind.
Today, a major threat to survival of these
organisms is 
deforestation . We know
that deforestation means clearing of
forests and using that land for other
purposes. T rees in the for est ar e cut for
some of the purposes mentioned below:
/circle6Procuring land for cultivation.
/circle6Building houses and factories.
/circle6Making furniture or using wood as
fuel.How does deforestation reduce

lead to floods on the other?
decr ease. Mor eover , ther e will be
increased chances of natural calamities
such as floods and droughts.
Recall that plants need carbon
dioxide for photosynthesis. Fewer trees
would mean that less carbon dioxide will
be used up resulting in its increasedWhat is the purpose of
making national parks,
wildlife sanctuaries and
biosphere reserves?
2018-19


SCIENCE 78amount in the atmosphere. This will lead
to global warming as carbon dioxide
traps the heat rays reflected by the earth.
The increase in temperature on the earth
disturbs the water cycle and may reduce
rainfall. This could cause droughts .
Deforestation is a major cause which
leads to the change in soil properties.
Physical properties of the soil get affected
by plantation and vegetation. Recall from
Class VII how trees prevent soil erosion.
Fewer trees result in more soil erosion.
Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes
the lower , hard and r ocky layers. This soil
has less humus and is less fertile.
Gradually the fertile land gets converted
into deserts. It is called desertification .
Deforestation also leads to a decrease
in the water holding capacity of the soil.
The movement of water from the soil
surface into the gr ound (infiltration rate)
is reduced. So, there are floods. The
other properties of the soil like nutrient
content, texture etc., also change
because of deforestation.
We have studied in Class VII that we
get many products from forests. List these
products. Will we face shortage of these
products if we continue cutting trees?
Activity 7.2
Animal life is also affected by
deforestation. How? List the points
and discuss them in your class.
7.3 Conservation of Forest
and Wildlife
Having become aware of the effects of
deforestation, Paheli and Boojho are
worried. They go to Professor Ahmad
and ask him how forests and wildlife
can be saved.Biosphere is that part of the earth in
which living organisms exist or which
supports life. Biological diversity or
biodiversity, refers  to the variety of
organisms existing on the earth, their
interrelationships and their
relationship with the environment.
Professor  Ahmad organi s
es a visit to
a biosphere reserve for Paheli, Boojho and
their classmates. He selects a place
named Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. He
knows that the plants and animals found
here are similar to those of the upper
Himalayan peaks and to those belonging
to the lower western ghats. Professor
Ahmad believes that the biodiversity
found here is unique. He requests
Madhavji, a forest employee, to guide the
children inside the biosphere reserve. He
explains that preserving areas of such
biological importance make them a part
of our national heritage .
Madhavji explains to the children
that apart from our personal efforts and
efforts of the society, government
To protect our flora and fauna and their
habitats, protected areas  called
wildlife sanctuaries, national parks
and biosphere reserves have been
earmarked. Plantation, cultivation,
grazing, felling trees, hunting and
poaching are prohibited there.
Wildlife Sanctuary :  Areas where
animals are protected from any
disturbance to them and their habitat .
National Park : Areas reserved for
wild life where they can freely use the
habitats and natural resources.
Biosphere Reserve : Large areas of
protected land for conservation of wild
life, plant and animal resources and
traditional life of the tribals living in
the area.

animals. The government lays down
rules, methods and policies to protect
and conserve them. Wildlife sanctuaries,
national parks, biosphere reserves etc.,
are protected areas for conservation
of plants and animals present in
that area.

Children along with Professor Ahmad
and Madhavji enter the biosphere
reserve area. Madhavji explains that
biosphere reserves  are the areas meant
for conservation of biodiversity. As you
are aware that biodiversity is the variety
of plants, animals and microorganisms
generally found in an area.  The
biosphere reserves  help to maintain the
biodiversity and culture of that area. A
biosphere reserve may also contain
other protected areas in it. The
Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve consists
of one national park named Satpura and
two wildlife sanctuaries named Bori and
Pachmarhi (Fig. 7.1).

7.5  Flora and Fauna
As the children walk around the
biosphere reserve they appreciate thegreen wealth of the forest. They are
very happy to see tall teak trees and
animals inside the forest. Suddenly,
Paheli finds a rabbit and wants to
catch it. She starts running after it.
Professor Ahmad stops her . He
explains that animals are comfortable
and happy in their own habitat. W e
should not disturb them. Madhavji
explains that some animals and plants
typically belong to a particular area.
The plants and animals found in a
particular area are termed flora  and
fauna  respectively  of that area.
Sal, teak, mango, jamun , silver ferns, arjun,  etc., are the flora and chinkara , blue-
bull, barking deer , cheetal , leopar d, wild dog, wolf, etc. ar e examples of the fauna

endemic species may vanish.
Is it true?Activity 7.5

of your area and list them.
7.6Endemic Species
Soon the group quietly enters the deep
forest. Children are surprised to see a
very big squirrel. This squirrel has a big
fluffy tail. They are very curious to know
about it. Madhavji tells them that this
is known as the giant squirrel and is
endemic to this area.
Endemic species  are those species
of plants and animals which are found
exclusively in a particular area. They are
not naturally found  anywhere else. A
particular type of animal or plant may
be endemic to a zone, a state or a country.
Madhavji shows sal  and wild mango
(Fig. 7.3 (a)] as two  examples of the

Fig. 7.3 (b) :  Giant squirrelendemic flora of the Pachmarhi
Biosphere Reserve. Bison, Indian giant
squirrel [Fig. 7.3 (b)] and flying squirrel
are endemic fauna of this area. Professor
Ahmad explains that the destruction of
their habitat,  increasing population and
introduction of new species may affect
the natural habitat of endemic species
and endanger their existence.
Species  is a group of population
which are capable of interbreeding.
This means that the members of a
species can reproduce fertile offspring
only with the members of their own
species and not with members of
other species. Members of a species
have common characteristics.

animals of the region where you live.

SCIENCE 827.7 Wildlife Sanctuary
Soon Paheli sees a board with ‘Pachmarhi
Wildlife Sanctuary’ written on it.
Professor Ahmad explains that killing
(poaching) or capturing animals in general
is strictly prohibited and punishable
by law in all such places. Wildlife
Sanctuaries  like reserve forests provide
protection and suitable living conditions
to wild animals. He also tells them that
people living in wildlife sanctuaries are
allowed to do certain activities such as
grazing by their livestock, collecting
medicinal plants, firewood, etc.instead of  their natural habitat? In
your opinion, will the animals be
comfortable in a zoo or in their
natural habitat?
7.8  National Park
On the roadside there was another
board on which was written ‘Satpura
National Park’.
Children are now eager to go there.
Madhavji tells them that these reserves
are large and diverse enough to protect
whole sets of ecosystems. They preserve
flora, fauna, landscape and historic
objects of an area. Satpura National
Park is the first Reserve Forest of India.
The finest Indian teak is found in this
forest.  There are more than one hundred
National Parks i n India.
 It is a pity that even protected forests
are not safe because people living in the
neighbourhood encroach upon them
and destroy them.
Children are reminded of their visit
to the zoo. They recall that zoos are also
places where animals receive protection.Some of the threatened wild animals
like black buck, white eyed buck,
elephant, golden cat, pink headed
duck, gharial, marsh crocodile,
python, rhinoceros, etc., are
protected and preserved in our wild
life sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries
have unique landscapes—broad level
forests, mountain forests and bush
lands in deltas of big rivers.
Activity 7.7
Visit a nearby zoo. Observe the
conditions provided to the animals.
Were they suitable for the animals?
Can animals live in artificial settingRock shelters are also found inside
the Satpura National Park. These are
evidences of prehistoric human life
in these jungles. These give us an
idea of the life of primitive people.
Rock paintings are found in these
shelters. A total of 55 rock shelters
have been identified in Pachmarhi
Biosphere Reserve.
Figures of animals and men
fighting, hunting, dancing and
playing musical instruments are
depicted in these paintings. Many
tribals still live in the area.
As children move ahead, they see a
boar d with ‘Satpura T iger Reserve’
written on it. Madhavji explains that
Project Tiger  was launched by the
government to protect the tigers in the
country. The objective of this project
was to ensure the survival and
maintenance of the tiger population in
the country.What is the difference between
a zoo and a wildlife sanctuary?
2018-19


CONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 83Are tigers still found in this
forest? I hope I can see a tiger!
Tiger (Fig. 7.4) is one of the many
species which are slowly disappearing
from our for ests. But, the Satpura T iger
Reserve is unique in the sense that a
significant increase in the population of
tigers has been seen here. Once upon a
time, animals like lions, elephants, wild
animals has become difficult because of
disturbances in their natural habitat.
Professor Ahmad tells them that in order
to protect plants and animals strict rules
are imposed in all National Parks.
Human activities such as grazing,
poaching, hunting, capturing of animals
Fig. 7.4 :  Tiger
buffaloes (Fig. 7.5) and barasingha (Fig.
7.6) were also found in the Satpura
National Park. Animals whose numbers
are diminishing to a level that they might
face extinction are known as the
endangered animals . Boojho is
reminded of the dinosaurs which became
extinct a long time ago. Survival of some

Are only big animals
facing extinction?
Madhavji tells Paheli that small
animals are much more in danger of
becoming extinct than the bigger
animals. At times, we kill snakes,
frogs, lizards, bats and owls ruthlessly
without realising their importance in
the ecosystem. By killing them we are
harming ourselves. They might be
small in size but their role in the
ecosystem cannot be ignored. They
form part of food chains and food
webs, about which you learnt in
Class VII.
An ecosystem  is made of all the
plants, animals and microorganisms in
an area along with non-living
components such as climate, soil,
river deltas etc.or collection of firewood,
mdicinal plants, etc. are
not allowed

SCIENCE 847.9Red Data Book
Professor  Ahmad explains about Red
Data Book to the children. He tells
them that Red Data Book  is the
source book which keeps a record of
all the endangered animals and
plants. Red  Data Book is maintained
internationally by an organisation .
India also maintains Red Data Book
for plants and animal s found
in India.
7.10  Migration
The excursion party then enters deeper
into the forest under the guidance of
Madhavji. They sit near the Tawa
What would happen if we
had no wood? Is there
any alternative
available to wood?
I know that paper is one
of the important products
we get from forests.
I wonder whether
there are any alternatives
available for paper!Is there any permanent
solution to the problem
of deforestation?Reservoir to relax for some time. Paheli
observes some of the birds near the
river. Madhavji tells the childr en that
these are migratory birds. These birds
have flown here from other parts of
the world.
Migratory birds fly to far away areas
every year during a particular time
because of climatic changes. They fly
for laying eggs as the weather in their
natural habitat becomes very cold and
inhospitable. Birds who cover long
distances to reach another land are
known as migratory birds as Paheli
learnt in Class VII.
7.11  Recycling of Paper
Professor  Ahmad draws attention of
the children to another cause of
deforestation. He tells them that it
takes 17 full grown trees to make one
tonne of paper . Ther efore, we should
save paper . Professor  Ahmad also tells
that paper can be recycled five to seven
times for use. If each student saves at
least one sheet of paper in a day, we
can save many tr ees in a year . We
should save, reuse used paper and
recycle it. By this we not only save
trees but also save  energy and water
needed for manufacturing paper .
Moreover , the amount of har mful
chemicals used in paper making will
also be reduced.I wonder if there is
any record of all
endangered species!
2018-19


CONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 857.12  Reforestation
Professor Ahmad suggests that the
answer to deforestation is reforestation.
Reforestation is restocking of the
destroyed forests by planting new trees.
The planted trees should generally be
of the same species which were found
in that for est. W e should plant at least
as many trees as we cut. Reforestation
can take place naturally also. If the
deforested area is left undisturbed, it re-
establishes itself. In natural reforestation
there is no r ole of human beings. W e
have already caused tremendous
damage to our forests. If we have toretain our green wealth for future
generations, plantation of more trees is
the only option.
Professor Ahmad told them that in
India we have the Forest (Conservation)
Act. This act is aimed at preservation
and conservation of natural forests and
meeting the basic needs of the people
living in or near the forests.
After some rest Madhavji asks the
children to start heading back because
it is not advisable to stay in the
jungle after sunset. On getting back,
Professor Ahmad and the children
thank Madhavji for guiding them
through this exciting experience.

CELL — S TRUCTURE  AND FUNCTIONS CELL — S TRUCTURE  AND FUNCTIONS
You have alr eady lear nt that things
around us are either living or
non-living. Further , you may
recall that all living  organisms carry out
certain basic functions. Can you list
these functions?
Different sets of organs per form the
various functions you have listed. In this
chapter , you shall lear n about the basic
structural unit of an organ, which is the
cell.
 Cells may be compared to bricks.
Bricks are assembled to make a building.
Similarly, cells are assembled to make
the body of every organism.
8.1Discovery of the Cell
Robert Hooke in 1665 observed slices of
cork under a simple magnifying device.
Cork is a part of the bark of a
tree.  He took thin slices of cork and
observed them under a microscope. He
noticed partitioned boxes or
compartments in the cork slice (Fig. 8.1).These boxes appeared like a honey-
comb. He also noticed that one box was
separated from the other by a wall or
partition. Hooke coined the term ‘cell’
for each box. What Hooke observed as
boxes or cells in the cork were actually
dead cells.
Cells of living organisms could be
observed only after the discovery of
improved micr oscopes. V ery little was
known about the cell for the next 150
years after Robert Hooke’s observations.
Today, we know a lot about cell
structure and its functions because of
improved microscopes having high
magnification.
8.2 The Cell
Both, bricks in a building and cells in
the living organisms, are basic
structural units [Fig. 8.2(a), (b)]. The
buildings, though built of similar bricks,
have different designs, shapes and sizes.
Similarly, in the living world, organisms
differ from one another but all are made
up of cells. Cells in the living organisms
are complex living structures unlike
non-living bricks.
Fig. 8.1: Cork cells as observed by
Robert Hooke
A hen’s egg can be seen
easily. Is it a cell or a
group of cells?
2018-19


The egg of a hen represents a single
cell and is big enough to be seen by the
unaided eye.
8.3Organisms show V ariety
in Cell Number , Shape and
Size
How do scientists observe and study the
living cells? They use microscopes which
magnify objects. Stains (dyes) are used
to colour parts of the cell to study the
detailed structure.
There are millions of living
organisms. They are of different shapes
and sizes. Their organs also vary in
shape, size and number of cells. Let us
study about some of them.
Number of Cells
Can you guess the number of cells in a
tall tree or in a huge animal like the
elephant? The number runs into
billions and trillions. Human body has
trillions of cells which vary in shapes
and sizes. Different groups of cells
perfor m a variety of functions.Organisms made of more than one
cell are called multicellular  (multi  :
many; cellular : cell) organisms. The
number of cells being less in smaller
organisms does not, in any way, affect
the functioning of the or ganisms. Y ou
will be surprised to know that an
organism with billions of cells begins
life as a single cell  which is the fertilised
egg. The fertilised egg cell multiplies and
the number of cells increase as
development proceeds.
Look at Fig 8.3 (a) and (b). Both
organisms are made up of a single cell.
The single-celled organisms are called
unicellular  (uni : one; cellular  : cell)Fig. 8.2 :  Brick wall and onion peel

SCIENCE 92organisms. A single-celled organism
performs all the necessary functions
that multicellular organisms per form.
A single-celled organism, like
amoeba,  captures and digests food,
respires, excretes, grows and
reproduces. Similar functions in
multicellular organisms are carried out
by groups of specialised cells forming
dif
ferent tissues. Tissues, in tur n, for m
organs.
Activity 8.1
The teacher may show a permanent
slide of amoeba  and paramecium
under a microscope. Alternatively,
the teacher can collect pond water
and show these organisms by
preparing the slides.
Shape of Cells
Refer to Fig .
 8.3 (a). How do you define
the shape of amoeba  in the figur e? You
may say that the shape appears
irregular . Infact, amoeba  has no
definite shape, unlike other organisms.
It keeps on changing its shape.
Observe the projections of varying
lengths protruding out of its
body. These are called pseudopodia
(pseudo  : false; podia : feet),  as you
learnt in Class VII. These projections
appear and disappear as amoeba
moves or feeds.A white blood cell (WBC) in human
blood is another example of a single cell
which can change its shape. But while
WBC is a cell, amoeba is a full fledged
organism capable of independent
existence.
What shape would you expect in
organisms with millions of cells? Fig.
8.4 (a, b, c) shows different cells such
as blood, muscle and nerve of human
beings. The different shapes are related
to their specific functions.
Generally, cells are round, spherical
or elongated [Fig. 8.4(a)]. Some cells are
long and pointed at both ends. They
exhibit a spindle shape [Fig. 8.4(b)].
Cells sometimes are quite long. Some
are branched like the nerve cell or a
neuron [Fig. 8.4(c)]. The nerve cell
receives and transfers messages, therebyThe change in shape is due to
formation of pseudopodia which
facilitates movement and help
in capturing food.

in a rat. The size of the cell is related to
its function. For example, nerve cells,
both in the elephant and rat, are long
and branched. They per form the same
function, that of transferring messages.
8.4Cell Structure and
Function
You have lear nt that each living
organism has many or gans. You have
studied in Class VII about the digestive
organs which together constitute the
digestive system. Each organ in the
system per forms dif ferent functions
such as  digestion, assimilation and
absorption. Similarly, different organs
of a plant per form specific/specialised
functions. For example, roots help in the
absorption of water and minerals.
Leaves, as you have learnt in Class VII,
are responsible for synthesis of food.
Each organ is further made up of
smaller parts called tissues . A tissue is
a group of similar cells per forming  a
specific function.
Paheli realised that an organ is made
up of tissues which in turn, are made
up of cells. The cell in a living organism
is the basic structural unit.
8.5Parts of the Cell
Cell Membrane
The basic components of a cell are cell
membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus
(Fig. 8.7)
. The cytoplasm and nucleus
are enclosed within the cell membrane,
also called the plasma membrane. The
membrane separates cells from one
another and also the cell from the
surrounding medium. The plasma
membrane is porous and allows thehelping to control and coordinate the
working of different parts of the body.
Can you guess, which part of the cell
gives it shape? Components of the cell
are enclosed in a membrane. This
membrane provides shape to the cells
of plants and animals. Cell wall is an
additional covering over the cell
membrane in plant cells.  It gives shape
and rigidity to these cells (Fig. 8.7).
Bacterial cell also has a cell wall.
Size of Cells
The size of cells in living organisms may
be as small as a millionth of a metre
(micrometre or micron) or may be as large
as a few centimetr es. However , most of the
cells are microscopic in size and are not
visible to the unaided eye. They need to
be enlarged or magnified by a microscope.
The smallest cell is 0.1 to 0.5 micrometre
in bacteria.  The largest cell measuring
170 mm ×130 mm, is the egg of an ostrich.
Activity 8.2
Boil a hen’s egg. Remove the shell.
What do you observe? A white
material surrounds the yellow part.
White material is albumin which
solidifies on boiling. The yellow part
is yolk. It is part of the  single cell.
You can observe this single cell
without any magnifying device.
Are the cells in an
elephant larger than the
cells in a rat?
The size of the cells has no relation
with the size of the body of the animal or
plant. It is not necessary that the cells in

Activity 8.3
In order to observe the basic
components of the cell, take an
onion bulb. Remove the dry pink
coverings (peels). Y ou can easily
separate these from the fleshy white
layers of the bulb with the help of
forceps or even with your hand. Y ou
can also break the onion bulb and
separate out thin  layers. Place a
small piece of the thin onion peel
in a drop of water on a glass slide.
The thin layer can be cut into
smaller pieces with the help of a
blade or forceps. Add a drop of
methylene blue solution to the layer
and place a coverslip on it. While
placing the coverslip ensure that
there are no air bubbles under the
coverslip. Observe the slide under
the micr oscope. Draw and label. Y ou
may compare it with Fig. 8.5.between the nucleus and the cell
membrane is called cytoplasm.
I want to know why plant
cells need cell walls?
You have lear nt earlier that the cell
membrane gives shape to the cell. In
addition to the cell membrane, there is
an outer thick layer in cells of plants
called cell wall . This additional layer
surrounding the cell membrane is
required by plants for protection. Plant
cells need protection against variations
in temperature, high wind speed,
atmospheric moisture etc. They
are exposed to these variations
because they cannot move. Cells can
be observed in the leaf peel of
Tradescantia,  Elodea or Rhoeo . You
can prepare a slide as in the case
of onion.
Paheli asks Boojho if he can also
observe animal cells.
Activity 8.4
Take a clean tooth pick, or a
matchstick with the tip broken.
Scrape inside of your cheek without
hurting it. Place it in a drop of water
on a glass slide. Add a drop of iodine
and place a coverslip over it.
Alternatively, add 1-2 drops of
methylene blue solution. Observe it
under the micr oscope. Y ou may
notice several cells in the scraped
material (Fig. 8.6). Y ou can identify
the cell membrane, the cytoplasm
and nucleus. A cell wall is absent
in animal cells.The boundary of the onion cell is the
cell membrane  covered by another thick
covering called the cell wall. The central
dense round body in the centre is called
the nucleus . The jelly-like substance
Fig. 8.5 : Cells observed in an onion peelnucleus
cytoplasm
2018-19


CELL — S TRUCTURE  AND FUNCTIONS 95Cytoplasm
It is the jelly-like substance present
between the cell membrane and the
nucleus. V arious other components, or
organelles , of cells are present in the
cytoplasm. These are mitochondria, golgi
bodies, ribosomes, etc. Y ou will lear n
about them in later classes.
Nucleus
It is an important component of the
living cell. It is generally spherical and
located in the centre of the cell. It can
be stained and seen easily with the help
of a microscope. Nucleus is separated
from the cytoplasm by a membrane
called the nuclear membrane . This
membrane is also porous and allows the
movement of materials between the
cytoplasm and the inside of the nucleus.
With a microscope of higher
magnification, we can see a smaller
spherical body in the nucleus. It is called
the nucleolus . In addition, nucleus
contains thread-like structures called
chromosomes . These carry genes  and
help in inheritance or transfer of
characters from the parents to the
offspring . The chromosomes can be seen
only when the cell divides.
Nucleus, in addition to its role in
inheritance, acts as control centre of the
activities of the cell. The entire content
of a living cell is known as protoplasm.
It includes the cytoplasm and the
nucleus. Protoplasm is called the living
substance of the cell.Gene
Gene is a unit of inheritance in living
organisms. It controls the transfer of
a hereditary characteristic from
parents to offspring. This means that
your parents pass some of their
characteristics on to you. If your father
has brown eyes, you may also have
brown eyes. If your mother has curly
hair, you might also end up having
curly hair . However , the dif ferent
combination of genes from parents
result in different characteristics.
Paheli wants to know if the
structure of the nucleus is
the same in cells of plants,
animals and bacteria.
The nucleus of the bacterial cell is
not well-organised like the cells of
multicellular organisms. There is no
nuclear membrane. The cells having
nuclear material without nuclear
membrane are termed prokaryotic
cells.  The organisms with these kinds
of cells are called prokaryotes (pro :
primitive; karyon  : nucleus). Examples
are bacteria and blue green algae. The
cells, like  onion cells and cheek cells
having well-organised nucleus with
a nuclear membrane are designated
as eukaryotic cells . All organisms
other than bacteria and blue
green algae are called eukaryotes .

SCIENCE 96While observing the onion cells
under the microscope, did you notice
any blank-looking structures in the
cytoplasm? It is called vacuole . It could
be single and big as in an onion cell.
Cheek cells have smaller vacuoles. Large
vacuoles are common in plant cells.
Vacuoles in animal cells ar e much
smaller .
You might have noticed several small
coloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the
cells of Tradescantia leaf. They ar e
scattered in the cytoplasm of the leaf
cells. These are called plastids . They are
of different colours. Some of them
contain green pigment called
chlorophyll. Green coloured plastids arecalled chloroplasts . They provide green
colour to the leaves. Y ou may r ecall that
chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of leaves,
is essential for photosynthesis.
8.6Comparison of Plant and
Animal Cells
If you recall Activities 8.3 and 8.4, you
should be able to compare plant and
animal cells. Observe the plant and
animal cell carefully in Fig. 8.7 (a), (b).
Let us tabulate the similarities and
disinguishing features of plant and
animal cells. Only a few features are
mentioned. Y ou may add mor e in

REPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS REPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS
Do you recall the processes of
digestion, circulation and
respiration which you have
studied in your previous classes? These
processes are essential for the survival
of every individual. Y ou have also lear nt
about the process of reproduction in
plants. Reproduction is essential for the
continuation of a species. Imagine what
would have happened if organisms had
not r eproduced. Y ou will r ealise that
reproduction is very important as it
ensures the continuation of similar
kinds of individuals, generation after
generation.
You have alr eady lear nt in your
previous class about reproduction in
plants. In this chapter , we shall lear n
how reproduction takes place in
animals.
9.1 Modes of Reproduction
Have you seen the young ones
of dif ferent animals? T ry to name some
of the young ones by completing
Table 9.1 shown in examples at S. No.
1 and 5.
You must have seen the young
ones of various animals being born.
Can you tell how chicks and
caterpillars are born? How are kittens
and puppies born? Do you think that
these young ones looked the same
before they were born as they do now?
Let us find out.Just as in plants, there are two modes
by which animals reproduce. These are:
(i)Sexual reproduction, and
(ii)Asexual reproduction.
9.2 Sexual Reproduction
Try to r ecall r eproduction in plants
which you studied in Class VII. Y ou will
remember that plants that reproduce
sexually have male and female
reproductive parts. Can you name these
parts? In animals also, males and
females have different reproductive parts
or organs. Like plants, the reproductive
parts in animals also produce gametes
that fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote
which develops into a new individual.
This type of reproduction beginning
from the fusion of male and female
gametes is called sexual reproduction .
Let us find out the reproductive partsTable 9.1

in humans and study the process of
reproduction in them.
Male Reproductive Organs
The male reproductive organs include a
pair of testes (singular , testis), two sper m
ducts and a penis (Fig. 9.1). The testes
produce the male gametes called
sperms . Millions of sperms are produced
by the testes. Look at Fig. 9.2 which
shows the picture of a sperm. Though
sperms are very small in size, each has
a head, a middle piece and a tail. Does
it appear to be a single cell? Indeed, eachsperm is a single cell with all the usual
cell components.

organs in humansWhat purpose does the
tail in a sperm serve?

SCIENCE 102Boojho recalls that the size
of eggs in animals varies.
The egg may be very small
as in humans, much larger
as in hens. Ostrich egg is
the largest!
Fertilisation
The first step in the process of
reproduction is the fusion of a sperm
and an ovum. When sperms come in
contact with an egg, one of the sperms
may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of
the egg and the sperm is called
fertilisation (Fig. 9.5). During
fertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and
the egg fuse to form a single nucleus.
This results in the formation of a
fertilised egg or zygote  (Fig. 9.6). Did

The process of fertilisation is the
meeting of an egg cell from the mother
and a sper m cell fr om the father . So,
the new individual inherits some
characteristics  from the mother and
some fr om the father . Look at your
brother or sister . See if you can r ecognise
some characters in them similar to those
of your mother or your father .
Fertilisation which takes place inside
the female body is called internal
fertilisation . Internal fertilisation
occurs in many animals including
humans, cows, dogs and hens.Fig. 9.6 :  Zygotefemale gametes called ova (eggs)
(Fig. 9.4). In human beings, a single
matured egg is released into the oviduct
by one of the ovaries every month.
Uterus is the part where development of
the baby takes place. Like the sperm,
an egg is also a single cell.
you know that the zygote is the
beginning of a new individual?

REPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 103Why do fish and
frogs lay eggs in
hundreds whereas a
hen lays only one
egg at a time?
Have you heard of
test tube babies?
Boojho and Paheli’s teacher once told
them in the class that in some women
oviducts are blocked. These women
are unable to bear babies because
sperms cannot reach the egg for
fertilisation. In such cases, doctors
collect freshly released egg and
sperms and keep them together for a
few hours for IVF or in vitro
fertilisation  (fertilisation outside the
body). In case fertilisation occurs,
the zygote is allowed to develop for
about a week and then it is placed in
the mother’s uterus. Complete
development takes place in the uterus
and the baby is born like any other
baby. Babies born through this
technique are called test-tube
babies . This term is actually
misleading because babies cannot
grow in test tubes.Fig. 9.7 :  Eggs of frogfemale lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike
hen’s egg, frog’s egg is not covered by a
shell and it is comparatively very
delicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs
together and provides protection to the
eggs (Fig. 9.7).
You will be surprised to know that
in many animals fertili sation takes
place outside the body of the female.
In these animals, fertili sation takes
place in water . Let us find out how
this happens.
Activity 9.1
Visit some ponds or slow-flowing
streams during spring or rainy
season. Look out for clusters of
frog’s eggs floating in water .
Write down the colour and size of
the eggs.
During spring or rainy season, frogs
and toads move to ponds and slow-
flowing streams. When the male and
female come together in water , theAs the eggs are laid, the male
deposits sperms over them. Each
sperm swims randomly in water with
the help of its long tail. The sperms
come in contact with the eggs. This
results in fertili sation. This type of
fertili s
ation in which the fusion of a
male and a female gamete takes place
outside the body of the female is called
external fertili sation . It is very
common in aquatic animals such as
fish, star fish, etc.

SCIENCE 104
Development of Embryo
Fertilisation results in the formation of
zygote which begins to develop into an
embryo [Fig. 9.8(a)]. The zygote divides
repeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells
[Fig. 9.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form
groups that develop into different tissues
and organs of the body. This developing
structure is termed an embryo . The
embryo gets embedded in the wall of the
uterus for further development
[Fig. 9.8(c)].
The embryo continues to develop in
the uterus. It gradually develops body

Though these animals lay
hundreds of eggs and release
millions of sperms, all the eggs
do not get fertilised and develop
into new individuals.
This is because the eggs and
sperms get exposed to  water
movement, wind and rainfall.
Also, there are other animals in
the pond which may feed
on eggs. Thus, production
of large number of eggs and

REPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 105parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes,
ears etc. The stage of the embryo in
which all the body parts can be
identified is called a foetus (Fig. 9.9).
When the development of the foetus is
complete,  the mother gives birth to
the baby.place inside the egg shell during this
period? After the chick is completely
developed it bursts open the egg shell.
In animals which undergo external
fertilisation, development of the embryo
takes place outside the female body. The
embryos continue to grow within their
egg coverings. After the embryos develop,
the eggs hatch. Y
ou must have seen
numerous tadpoles swimming in ponds
and streams.
Viviparous and Oviparous Animals
We have learnt that some animals give
birth to young ones while some animals
lay eggs which later develop into young
ones. The animals which give birth to
young ones are called viviparous
animals. Those animals which lay eggs
are called oviparous animals. The
following activity will help you
understand better and differentiate
between viviparous and oviparous
animals.
Activity 9.2
Try to observe eggs of the following
organisms – fr og, lizar
d, butter fly
or moth, hen and crow or any other
bird. W ere you able to observe eggs
of all of them? Make drawings of  the
eggs that you have observed.
The eggs of a few animals are easy
to observe  because their mothers lay
them outside their bodies. These are
examples of oviparous animals. But you
would not be able to collect the eggs of
a dog, cow or cat. This is because they
do not lay eggs. The mother gives birth
to the young ones. These are examples
of viviparous animals.Fig. 9.9 :  Foetus in the uterusUterus
Internal fertilisation takes place in
hens also. But, do hens give birth to
babies like human beings and cows? Y ou
know that they do not. Then, how are
chicks born? Let us find out.
Soon after fertilisation, the zygote
divides repeatedly and travels down the
oviduct. As it travels down, many
protective layers are formed around it.
The hard shell that you see in a hen’s
egg is one such pr otective layer .
After the hard shell is formed around
the developing embryo, the hen finally
lays the egg. The embryo takes about 3
weeks to develop into a chick. Y ou must
have seen the hen sitting on the eggs to
provide sufficient warmth. Did you know
that development of the chick takes

SCIENCE 106
Can you now give some more
examples of viviparous and oviparous
animals?
Young Ones to Adults
The new individuals which are born or
hatched from the eggs continue to grow
till they become adults. In some
animals, the young ones may look very
different from the adults. Recall the life
cycle of the silkworm (egg → larva or
caterpillar → pupa → adult) you studied
in Class VII. Frog is another such
example (Fig. 9.10).
Observe the different stages of frog
starting from the egg to the adult stage.
We find that ther e are thr ee distinct
stages, that is, egg → tadpole (larva) →
adult. Don’t the tadpoles look so
different from the adults? Can you
imagine that these tadpoles would some
day become frogs? Similarly, the
caterpillar or the pupa of silkworm looks
very different from the adult  moth . Thefeatures that are present in the adult are
not found in these young ones. Then what
happens to the tadpoles or caterpillars
thereafter?
You must have seen a beautiful moth
emerging out of the cocoon. In the case of
tadpoles, they transform into adults
capable of jumping and swimming. The
transformation of the larva into an adult
through drastic changes is called
metamorphosis . What about the changes
that we observe in our body as we grow?
Do you think we too undergo
metamorphosis? In human beings, body
parts similar to those present in the adults
are present from the time of birth.
9.3 Asexual Reproduction
So far , we have lear nt about r epr
oduction
in some familiar animals. But what
about very small animals like hydra and
microscopic organisms like amoeba? Do
you know how they reproduce? Let us

Daughter amoebaeIn each hydra, there may be one or
more  bulges. These bulges are the
developing new individuals and they are
called buds. Recall the presence of buds
in yeast. In hydra too the new individuals
develop as outgrowths from a single
parent. This type of reproduction in
which only a single parent is involved is
called asexual reproduction . Since new
individuals develop from the buds in
hydra, this type of asexual reproduction
is called budding .
Another method of asexual
reproduction is observed in the
microscopic organism, amoeba. Let us
see how this happens.
You have alr eady lear nt about the
structur e of amoeba. Y ou will r ecall that
amoeba is a single-celled organism
[Fig. 9.12(a)]. It begins the process of
reproduction by the division of its
nucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 9.12(b)].
This is followed by division of its body
into two, each part receiving a nucleus
[Fig. 9.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are
produced from one parent amoeba
[Fig. 9.12(d)]. This type of asexual

SCIENCE 108Story of Dolly, the Clone
Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a
complete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first
time by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,
Scotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 9.13 (c)]. Dolly was
born on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.
(a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly
Fig. 9.13
During the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland
of a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 9.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained
from a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 9.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the
egg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep
was inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been
removed. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.
Development of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though
Dolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely
identical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the
nucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not
show any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of
the Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal
sexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain
lung disease.
Since Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals.
However , many die befor e birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals ar e
many-a-times found to be born with severe abnormalities.
reproduction in which an animal
reproduces by dividing into two
individuals is called binary fission .
Apart from budding and binary fission,there are other methods by which a
single parent reproduces young ones.
You will study about these in your
higher classes.

queen bee. All other female bees are worker bees. Their main job is to build the
hive, look after the young and feed the queen bee adequately to keep her
healthy so that she can lay eggs. A queen bee lays thousands of eggs. The
fertili sed eggs hatch into females, while the unfertili sed eggs give rise to males ,
called drones. It is the job of the worker bees to maintain the temperature of

REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE
In the pr evious chapter , you have
learnt how animals reproduce. It is
only after ‘growing up’ to a certain
age that human beings and many other
animals can reproduce. Why can
humans reproduce only after a certain
age?
In this chapter , you will lear n about
changes that take place in the human
body after which a person becomes
capable of reproduction.
In Chapter 9 ,
 you have learnt about
human reproductive organs. Here, we
shall discuss the role that hormones play
in bringing about changes that make a
child grow into an adult.
10.1 Adolescence and Puberty
Boojho was celebrating his 12th
birthday. After his friends left, Boojho
and Paheli began chatting with their
parents. Paheli studies in an all-girls
school. She started laughing. She
remarked that many of Boojho’s  school
friends, whom she met after a year , had
suddenly shot up in height. Some of
them were looking very funny with a
hairy line above their lips. Her mother
explained that the boys had grown up.
Growth begins from the day one is
born. But upon crossing the age of 10
or 11, there is a sudden spurt in growth
which becomes noticeable. The changes
taking place in the body are part of
growing up. They indicate that you areI wonder how long this
period marked by changes

no longer  a child but are on the way to
becoming an adult.
It is a strange period of life
when you are neither a child nor
an adult. I wonder whether this
period between childhood and
adulthood had a special name!
Growing up is a natural process. The
period of life, when the body undergoes
changes, leading to reproductive
maturity, is called adolescence.
Adolescence begins around the age of
11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age.
Since this period covers the ‘teens’ (13
to 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents
are also called ‘teenagers’. In girls,
adolescence may begin a year or two
earlier than in boys. Also, the period of
adolescence  varies  from person to person.
The human body undergoes several
changes during adolescence. These
changes mark the onset of puberty . The
most important change which marks
puberty is that boys and girls become
capable of reproduction. Puberty ends
when an adolescent reaches reproductive
maturity.

realised that sudden
increase in height and
hairy line above the lips
in boys were signs of
adolescence. They
wanted to know more
about other changes at
puberty.
10.2 Changes at Puberty
Increase in Height
The most conspicuous change during
puberty is the sudden increase in
height. At this time the long bones, that
is, the bones of the arms and the legs
elongate and make a person tall.
Activity 10.1
The following chart gives the
average rate of growth in height of
boys and girls with age. The figures
in columns 2 and 3, give the
percentage of the height a person
has reached at the age given in
column 1. For example, by the age
11, a boy has reached 81% of his
probable full height, while a girl
has reached 88% of her full
height. These figures are only
representative and there may be
individual variations.

to be. Find out who is likely to beCalculation for full height (cm)

shortest in your class.
2018-19


REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 115There is no need for Paheli to worry.
All parts of the body do not grow at the
same rate. Sometimes the arms and legs
or hands and feet of adolescents look
oversized and out of proportion with the
body. But soon the other parts catch
up and result in a proportionate body.
You must have noticed that height
of an individual is more or less similar
to that of some family member . This is
because height depends on the genes
inherited fr om par ents. It is, however ,
very important to eat the right kind of
food during these growing years. This
helps the bones, muscles and other
parts of the body get adequate
nourishment for gr owth. Y ou will find
nutritional needs of adolescents
discussed later in the lesson.
Change in Body Shape
Have you noticed that boys in your class
have broader shoulders and wider chests
than boys in  junior classes? This is
because they have entered the age of
puberty when shoulders generally
broaden as a result of growth. In girls,
the region below the waist becomes
wider .
In boys, the muscles of the body grow
more prominently than in the girls.
Thus, changes occurring in adolescent
boys and girls are different.
Voice Change
Did you notice that sometimes the voice
of some of the boys in your class cracks?
At puberty, the voice box  or the larynx
begins to grow. Boys develop larger voice
boxes. The growing voice box in boys can
be seen as a protruding part of the throatActivity 10.2
Use the data given in Activity 10.1
to draw a graph. Take age on the X-
axis and per cent growth in height
on the Y-axis. Highlight the point
representing your age on the graph.
Find out the percentage of height
you have already reached. Calculate
the height you might eventually
reach. Tally your graph with the one
given here (Fig. 10.1).
Fig. 10.1 : Graph showing percentage of height
with age
I am worried. Though I
have become taller , my
face looks much smaller
compared to my body.
Initially, girls grow faster than boys
but by about 18 years of age, both reach
their maximum height. The rate of
growth in height varies in different
individuals. Some may grow suddenly
at puberty and then slow down, while
others may grow gradually.

because of the increased activity of these
glands in the skin.
Development of Sex Organs
Look up Fig. 9.1 and 9.3 of the
previous lesson which show sex
organs of humans. At puberty, male
sex organs like the testes and penis
develop completely. The testes also
begin to produce sperms. In girls, the
ovaries enlarge and eggs begin to
mature. Also ovaries start releasing
mature eggs .
Reaching Mental, Intellectual and
Emotional Maturity
Adolescence is also a period of change
in a person’s way of thinking.
Adolescents are more independent than
before and are also self conscious.
Intellectual development takes place and
they tend to spend considerable time
thinking. In fact, it is often the time in
one’s life when the brain has the
greatest capacity for learning.
Sometimes, however , an adolescent may
feel insecure while trying to adjust to
the changes in the body and mind. But
as adolescent learners, you should know
that there is no reason to feel insecure.
These changes are a natural part of
growing up.
10.3 Secondary Sexual
Characters
You have lear nt in Chapter 9, that
testes and ovaries are the reproductive
organs. They produce the gametes,
that is, sperms and ova. In girls,
breasts begin to develop at pubertyMany of my classmates
have a hoarse voice. Now I
know why?
Fig. 10.2 : Adam’s apple in a grown up boycalled Adam’s apple  (Fig. 10.2). In girls,
the larynx is hardly visible from the
outside because of its small size.
Generally, girls have a high pitched voice,
whereas boys have a deep voice. In
adolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles
of the growing voice box go out of control
and the voice becomes hoarse. This state
may remain for a few days or weeks after
which the voice becomes normal.
A few glands such as sweat glands,
oil glands and salivary glands release
their secretions through ducts.
Endocrine glands release hormones
directly into the bloodstream. So, they
are also termed ductless glands.Increased Activity of Sweat and

REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 117and boys begin to gr ow facial hair , that
is, moustaches and beard. As these
features help to distinguish the male
from the female they are called
secondary sexual characters . Boys
also develop hair on their chest. In
both, boys and girls, hair grows under
the arms and in the region above the
thighs or the pubic region.
Paheli and Boojho have now
understood that puberty marks the
beginning of the reproductive period
when one becomes capable of
reproduction. But they want to know
if reproductive life, once begun,
continues, or it ends some time.The testes and ovaries secrete sex
hormones. Y ou have just lear nt that
these hormones are responsible for the
male and female secondary sexual
characters. Further , the sex hor mones
are under the control of hormones from
the pituitary gland (Fig. 10.3). The
pituitary secretes many hormones, one
of which makes ova mature in the
ovaries and sperms form in the testes.
Both Boojho and Paheli wish to know
what initiates changes at puberty.
Fig. 10.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by
hormonesThe changes which occur at
adolescence are controlled by
hormones.  Hormones are chemical
substances. These are secretions from
endocrine glands , or endocrine system.
The male hormone or testosterone
begins to be released by the testes at
the onset of puberty. This causes
changes in boys about which you have
just learnt, for example, the growth of
facial hair . Once puberty is r eached in
girls, ovaries begin to produce the 
female
hormone or estrogen which makes the
breasts develop. Milk secreting glands
or mammary glands develop inside the
breasts. The production of these
hormones is under the control of
another hormone secreted from an
endocrine gland called pituitary gland .
10.4 Role of Hormones in
Initiating Reproductive
Function
Endocrine glands release hormones
into the bloodstream to reach a
particular body part called target site .
The target site responds to the
hormone. There are many endocrine
glands  or ductless glands in the body.

SCIENCE 11810.5 Reproductive Phase of
Life in Humans
Adolescents become capable of
reproduction when their testes and
ovaries begin to produce gametes. The
capacity for maturation  and production
of gametes lasts for a much longer time
in males than in females.
In females, the reproductive phase of
life begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of
age) and generally lasts till the age of
approximately 45 to 50 years. The ova
begin to mature with the onset of
puberty. One ovum matures and is
released by one of the ovaries once in
about 28 to 30 days. During this
period, the wall of the uterus becomes
thick so as to receive the egg, in case
it is fertilised and begins to develop.
This results in pregnancy. If
fertilisation does not occur , the
released egg, and the thickened lining
of the uterus along with its blood
vessels are shed off. This causes
bleeding in women which is called
menstruation . Menstruation occurs
once in about 28 to 30 days. The first
menstrual flow begins at puberty  and
is termed menarche . At 45 to 50 years
of age, the menstrual cycle stops.
Stoppage of menstruation is termed
menopause.  Initially, menstrual cycle
may be irr egular . It take some time to
become r egular .Menstrual cycle is controlled by
hormones. The cycle includes the
maturation of the egg, its release,
thickening of uterine wall and its
breakdown if pregnancy does not
occur . In case the egg is fertilised it
begins to divide and then gets
embedded in the uterus for further
development as you have learnt in
Chapter 9 (Fig. 9.8).
10.6 How is the Sex of the
Baby Determined?
I heard my mother and my
aunt talking about my cousin
who is going to have a baby.
They were discussing whether
she would give birth to a boy
or a girl. I wonder what makes
the fertilised egg develop
either into a boy or a girl!
Paheli says that the
reproductive life of a
woman lasts from
menarche to menopause.
Is she right?Boy or Girl?
Inside the fertilised egg or zygote is the
instruction for determining the sex of
the baby. This instruction is present in
the thread-like structures, called
chromosomes  in the fertilised egg.
Recall from Chapter 8, that
chromosomes are present inside the
nucleus of every cell. All human beings
have 23 pairs of chromosomes in the
nuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes
out of these are the sex chromosomes,
named X and Y . A female has two X
chromosomes, while a male has one X
and one Y chromosome. The gametes
(egg and sperm) have only one set of
chromosomes. The unfertilised egg
always has one X chromosome. But
2018-19


REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 119sperms are of two kinds. One kind has
an X chromosome, and the other kind
has a Y chromosome.
See Fig. 10.4. When a sperm
containing X chromosome fertilises the
egg, the zygote would have two X
chromosomes and develop into a female
child. If the sperm contributes a Y
chromosome to the egg (ovum) at
fertilisation, the zygote would develop
into a male child.and ovaries to produce their hormones.
You have alr eady lear nt that the
pituitary gland is an endocrine gland.
It is attached to the brain.
Apart from the pituitary, the testes
and the ovaries, there are other
endocrine glands in the body such as
thyroid, pancreas and adrenals
(Fig. 10.5).
Fig. 10.4 : Sex determination in humansboy girlsperms
eggs
Now you know that the sex
chromosomes of the father determine the
sex of an unborn baby. The belief that
the mother is responsible for the sex of
her baby is completely wrong and to
blame her for this is totally unjustified.

Boojho and Paheli had once visited
their aunt who was a doctor and
remembered that a boy named Kaka had
a very big and bulging throat. Their aunt
had told them that Kaka was suffering
from ‘goitre’, a disease of the thyroid
gland . Kaka’s thyroid gland was not
producing the hormone thyroxine .
2018-19


SCIENCE 120Their aunt also told them that their
uncle was suffering from ‘diabetes’
because his pancreas was not producing
the hormone insulin  in sufficient
quantities. Boojho and Paheli then
asked their aunt about the adrenal
glands, which are also shown in the
chart hung on the wall of her clinic. The
aunt told them that adrenal glands
secrete hormones which maintain the
correct salt balance in the blood.
Adrenals also produce the hormone
adrenalin.  It helps the body to adjust
to stress when one is very angry,
embarrassed or worried.
Thyroid and adrenals secrete their
hormones when they receive orders from
the pituitary through its hormones.
Pituitary also secretes growth hormone
which is necessary for the normal
growth of a person.This change from larva to adult is
called metamorphosis  (Fig. 9.10).
Metamorphosis in insects is controlled
by insect hormones.  In a frog, it is
controlled by thyroxine, the hormone
produced by thyroid.  Thyroxine
production requires the presence of
iodine in water . If the water in which
the tadpoles are growing does not
contain sufficient iodine, the tadpoles
cannot become adults.
Are there hormones in
other animals also? Have
they any role to play in
reproduction?If people do not have
enough iodine in their diet,
will they get goitre caused
by lack of thyroxine?
10.8 Role of Hor mones in
Completing the Life
History of Insects and
Frogs
You have alr eady lear nt about the life
history of the silk moth and the frog.
The caterpillar has to pass through
various stages to become an adult moth.
Recall from Class VII the stages of the
life history of the silk moth. Similarly,
the tadpole passes through certain
stages to become a frog (Chapter 9).Activity 10.3
Collect information from magazines
or from doctors and prepare a note
on the importance of consuming
iodised salt. Y ou can also look for
this information on the internet.
10.9 Reproductive Health
The physical and mental well being of
an individual is regarded as an
individual’s health. To keep the body
healthy, every human being, at any age,
needs to have a balanced diet. The
person must also observe personal
hygiene and undertake adequate
physical exercise.
During adolescence, however , these
become even more essential as the body
is growing.
Nutritional Needs of the Adolescents
Adolescence is a stage of rapid growth
and development. Hence the diet for an
2018-19


REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 121adolescent has to be carefully planned.
You have alr eady lear nt what a balanced
diet is. Recall that a balanced diet means
that the meals include proteins,
carbohydrates, fats and vitamins in
requisite proportions. Our Indian meal
of roti
/rice, dal  (pulses) and vegetables
is a balanced meal. Milk is a balanced
food in itself. Fruits also provide
nourishment. For infants, mother’s milk
provides all the nourishment that they
need.
Iron builds blood and iron-rich food
such as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat,
citrus, Indian gooseberry (amla)  are good
for adolescents.
Check items for lunch and dinner in
your meal. Is the meal balanced and
nutritious? Does it include cereals
which give energy and milk, meat, nuts
and pulses which provide proteins for
growth? Also, does it include fats and
sugar that give energy? What about
fruits and vegetables which are
protective foods? Chips and packed or
tinned snacks, though very tasty
should never replace regular meals as
they do not have adequate nutritional
value.
Activity 10.4
Make a group with your friends.
Write down the items of food in your
breakfast, lunch and dinner you
had on the previous day. Identify
the items responsible for proper
growth. Also identified the  junk
food that you consumed the
previous day.Personal Hygiene
Everyone should have a bath at least
once everyday. It is more necessary for
teenagers because the increased activity
of sweat glands sometimes makes the
body smelly. All parts of the body should
be washed and cleaned everyday. If

SCIENCE 122cleanliness is not maintained there are
chances of catching bacterial  infection.
Girls  should take special care of
cleanliness during the time of menstrual
flow. They should keep track of their
menstrual cycle and be prepared for the
onset of menstruation.
Physical exercise
Walking and playing in fr esh air keeps
the body fit and healthy. All young boys
and girls should take walks, exercise
and play outdoor games.Activity 10.6
Collect data on the number of
children in your class who exercise
regularly and who do not exercise
regularly. Did you notice any
difference in their fitness and
health? Prepare a report on the
benefits of regular exercise.
Say “NO” to Drugs
Adolescence is a period of much
activity in the body and mind which
is a normal part of growing up. So do
not feel confused or insecure. If
anybody suggests that you will get
relief if you take some drugs, just say
‘No’ unless pr escribed by the doctor .
Drugs are addictive. If you take them
once, you feel like taking them again
and again. They harm the body in the
long run. They ruin health and
happiness.
You must have hear d about AIDS
which is caused by a dangerous virus,
HIV. This virus can pass on to a
normal person from an infected
person by sharing the syringes used
for injecting drugs. It can also be
transmitted to an infant from the
infected  mother through her milk. The
virus  can also be transmitted through
sexual contact with a person infected
with HIV .
Adolescent Pregnancy
You might be knowing that in our country, the legal age for marriage is 18 years
for girls and 21 years for boys. This is because teenage mothers are not prepared
mentally or physically for motherhood. Early marriage and motherhood cause
health problems in the mother and the child. It also curtails employment
opportunities for the young woman and may cause mental agony as she is not
ready for responsibilities of motherhood.Myths, Taboos, Do’s and Don’ts
You have lear nt her e and fr om
Chapter 9 the scientific facts related
to human reproduction. There are
many wrong notions which you should
now be able to discard as informed
adolescents. For example, there are
myths and taboos regarding bodily
changes that adolescents experience.
Some of these are given below and
you can now argue why these are
myths and not facts.
1.A girl becomes pregnant if
she looks at boys during
menstruation.
2.The mother is responsible for the
sex of her child.
3.A girl should not be allowed to
work in the kitchen during
menstruation.
You may come acr oss many other myths
and taboos. Discard them.

FORCE  AND PRESSURE FORCE AND PRESSURE
In Class VII, you have learnt how
objects move. Do you recall how we
can decide whether an object is
moving faster than the other? What does
the distance moved by an object in unit
time indicate? Y ou also know that a
moving object like a ball rolling on the
ground slows down. Sometimes it may
change its direction of motion. It is also
possible that the ball may slow down
and also change its direction. Have you
ever wondered what makes an object
slow down or go faster , or change its
direction of motion?
Let us recall some of our everyday
experiences. What do you do to make
a football move? What do you do to
make a moving ball move faster? How
does a  goalkeeper stop a ball ? A
hockey player changes the direction
of the moving ball with a flick of the
stick . How do fielders stop a ball hitby a batsman?  (Fig. 11.1). In all these
situations the ball is either made to
move faster or slower or its direction
of motion is changed.
We often say that a for ce has been
applied on a ball when it is kicked,
pushed, thrown or flicked. What is a
force? What can it do to bodies on which
it is applied? W e shall seek answers to
such questions in this chapter .
11.1 Force – A Push or a Pull
Actions like picking, opening,
shutting, kicking, hitting, lifting,
flicking, pushing, pulling are often
used to describe certain tasks. Each
of these actions usually results in
some kind of change in the  state of
motion of an object.  Can these terms
be replaced with one or more terms?

Table 11.1 : Identifying Actions as Push or Pull
I learnt in Class VI that a
magnet attracts a piece of
iron towards it. Is attraction
also a pull?   What about
repulsion between similar
poles of two magnets? Is it a
pull or a push?Do you notice that each of the actions
can be grouped as a pull or a push or
both? Can we infer from this, that to move
an object, it has to be pushed or pulled?
In science, a push or a pull on an
object is called a force . Thus, we can
say that the motion imparted to objects
was due to the action of a force. When
does a force come into play? Let us
find out.

FORCE AND PRESSURE 129Fig 11.3 (b) :  Who is pulling whom ?
11.2 Forces are due to an
Interaction
Suppose a man is standing behind a
stationary car [Fig.11.2(a)]. Will the car
move due to his presence? Suppose the
man now begins to push the car
[Fig.11.2(b)], that is, he applies a force on
it. The car may begin to move in theFig. 11.3 shows three situations that
may be familiar to you. Can you decide
who is pulling and who is pushing in
these cases? In Fig. 11.3 (a), both the
girls appear to push each other while

man has to push the car to make it move.Fig.11.2 (a) : A man standing behind a stationary car
Fig 11.3 (c) :  Who is pulling whom ?
the pair of girls in Fig. 11.3 (b) are trying
to pull each other . Similarly, the cow
and the man in Fig. 11. 3(c) appear to
pull each other . The girls in the two
situations shown here are applying force
on each other . Is it also true for the man
and the cow?
From these examples, we can infer
that at least two objects must interact
for a force to come into play. Thus, an
interaction of one object with another
object results in a force between the
two objects.

SCIENCE 130Does it mean that the net
force on an object is zero if the
two forces acting on it in
opposite directions are equal?
rope in their direction. Sometimes the rope
simply does not move. Is it not similar to
the situation shown in Fig. 11.3 (b)? The
team that pulls har der, that is, applies a
larger force, finally wins the game.
What do these examples suggest
about the nature of force?
Forces applied on an object in the
same dir ection add  to one another . Now
recall what happened when you and
your friend pushed the heavy box in the
same direction in Activity 11.2.
If the two forces act in the opposite
directions on an object, the net force acting
on it is the difference between the two
forces . What did you observe in Activity
11.2 when both of you were pushing the
heavy box from opposite directions?
Recall that in the tug-of-war when
two teams pull equally hard, the rope
does not move in any direction.
So, we learn that a force could be larger
or smaller than the other  or equal to each
other . The str ength of a for ce is usually
expressed by its magnitude . We have also
to specify the direction in which a force acts.
Also, if the direction or the magnitude of the
applied force changes, its effect also changes.Activity 11.2
Choose a heavy object like a table
or a box, which you can move only
by pushing har d. Try to push it all
by yourself. Can you move it? Now
ask one of your friends to help you
in pushing it in the same direction
[Fig.11.4(a)]. Is it easier to move it
now? Can you explain why?
Now push the same object, but
ask your friend to push it from the
opposite side [Fig.11.4 (b)]. Does the
object move? If it does, note the
direction in which it moves. Can
you guess which one of you is
applying a larger force?

FORCE AND PRESSURE 131In general, more than one force may
be acting on an object. However , the
effect on the object is due to the net
force acting on it.
11.4 A Force can Change the
State of Motion
Let us now find out what happens when
a force acts on an object.
Activity 11.3
Take a rubber ball and place it on a
level sur face such as a table top or
a concr ete floor . Now, gently push
the ball along the level sur face
(Fig. 11.6). Does the ball begin to
move? Push the ball again while it
is still moving. Is there any change
in its speed? Does it increase or
decrease?
Next, place your palm in front
of the moving ball. Remove your
palm as soon as the moving ball
touches it. Does your palm apply a
force on the ball? What happens to
the speed of the ball now? Does it
increase or decrease? What would
happen if you let your palm hold
the moving ball?
Fig. 11.6  :  A ball at rest begins to move
when a force is applied on itI have seen
children competing with one
another in moving a rubber tyre
or a ring by pushing it
(Fig. 11.7).  I now understand
why the speed of the tyre
increases whenever it is
pushed.
Fig. 11.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be
pushed repeatedly
You might r ecall similar situations.
For example, while taking a penalty kick
in football, the player applies a force on
the ball. Before being hit, the ball was at
rest and so its speed was zero. The
applied force makes the ball move
towards the goal. Suppose, the
goalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the
goal. By his action the goalkeeper tries
to apply a force on the moving ball. The
force applied by him can stop or deflect
the ball, saving a goal being scored. If
the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the
ball, its speed decreases to zero.
These observations suggest that a
force applied on an object may change
its speed. If the force applied on the object
is in the direction of its motion, the speed
of the object increases. If the force is
applied in the direction opposite to the
direction of motion, then it results in a
decrease in the speed of the object.
2018-19


SCIENCE 132Let us consider some more
examples. In a game of volleyball,
players often push the moving ball to
their team  mates to make a winning
move. Sometimes the ball is returned
to the other side of the court by
pushing or smashing it. In cricket,  a
batsman plays his or her shot by
applying a force on the ball with the
bat. Is there any change in the
direction of motion of the ball in these
cases? In all these examples the speed
and the direction of the moving ball
change due to the application of a
force. Can you give a few more
examples of this kind?
A change in either the speed of an
object, or its direction of motion, or both,
is described as a change in its state of
motion . Thus, a force may bring a
change in the state of motion of an
object.
Fig. 11.8 : (a) A ball set in motion by
pushing it along a level surface
and (b) the direction of motion
of the ball after it strikes the
ruler placed in its path(a)State of Motion
The state of motion of an object is
described by its speed and the
direction of motion. The state of rest
is considered to be the state of zero
speed. An object may be at rest or in
motion; both are its states of motion.Paheli is curious to know whether
application of a force can only change the
speed of an object. Let us find out.
Activity 11.4
Take a ball and place it on a level
surface as you did in Activity 11.3.
Make the ball move by giving it a
push [Fig. 11.8(a)]. Now place a ruler
in its path as shown in Fig. 11.8(b).
In doing so, you would apply a force
on the moving ball. Does the ball
continue to move in the same
direction after it strikes the ruler?
Repeat the activity and try to
obstruct the moving ball by placing
the ruler in such a way that it
makes different angles to its path.
In each case note your observations
about the direction of motion of the
ball after it strikes the ruler .
(b)Does it mean that the application of
a force would always result in a change
in the state of motion of the object? Let
us find out.
It is common experience that many
a time application of force does not result
in a change in the state of motion. For
example, a heavy box may not move at
all even if you apply the maximum force
that you can exert. Again, no effect of
force is observed when you try to push
a wall.

SCIENCE 134
Fig.11.9 : Muscular force of animals is used to
carry out many difficult tasksWhat do you conclude from the
observations noted in Table 11.2?
What happens when you apply a force
on an inflated balloon by pressing it
between your palms? What happens
to the shape of a ball of dough when it
is rolled to make a chapati ? What
happens when  you press a rubber ball
placed on a table? In all these
examples you saw that the application
of force on an object may change its
shape .
Having per formed all the above
activities, you would have realised  that
a force
/circle6may make an object move from rest.
/circle6may change the speed of an object
if it is moving.
/circle6may change the direction of motion
of an object.
/circle6may bring about a change in the
shape of an object.
/circle6may cause some or all of these
effects.
While a force may cause one or more
of these effects, it is important to
remember that none of these actions can
take place without the action of a force.
Thus, an object cannot move by itself,
it cannot change speed by itself, it
cannot change direction by itself and
its shape cannot change by itself.
11.6 Contact Forces
Muscular Force
Can you push or lift a book lying on a
table without touching it? Can you lift
a bucket of water without holding it?
Generally, to apply a force on an object,
your body has to be in contact with the
object. The contact may also be with thehelp of a stick or a piece of rope.  When
we push an object like a school bag or
lift a bucket of water, wher e does the
force come from? This force is caused
by the action of muscles in our body.
The force resulting due to the action of
muscles is known as the muscular
force .
It is the muscular force that enables
us to perform all activities involving
movement or bending of our body. In
Class VII you have learnt that in the
process of digestion the food gets
pushed through the alimentary canal.
Could it be a muscular force that does
it? You also know that lungs expand
and contract while we inhale and
exhale air during breathing. Where
are these muscles located which
make breathing possible? Can you list
a few more examples of the force
exerted by the muscles in our body?
Animals also make use of muscular
force to carry out their physical activities
and other tasks. Animals like bullocks,
horses, donkeys and camels are used to
perform various tasks for us. In
per
forming these tasks they use
muscular force (Fig. 11.9).
2018-19


FORCE AND PRESSURE 135Since muscular force can be applied
only when it is in contact with an object,
it is also called a contact force . Are there
other types of contact forces? Let us find
out.
Friction
Recall some of your experiences. A ball
rolling along the ground gradually slows
down and finally comes to rest. When
we stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually
slows down and finally comes to a stop.
A car or a scooter also comes to rest
once its engine is switched off. Similarly,
a boat comes to rest if we stop rowing
it. Can you add some more such
experiences?
In all these situations no force
appears to be acting on the objects, yet
their speed gradually decreases and
they come to rest after some time. What
causes a change in their state of motion?
Could some force be acting on them!
Can you guess the direction in which
the force must be acting in each case?
The force responsible for changing the
state of motion of objects in all these
examples is the force of friction . It is the
force of friction between the sur face of
the ball and the ground that brings the
moving ball to rest. Similarly, friction
between water and the boat brings it to

The force of friction always acts on
all the moving objects and its direction
is always opposite to the direction of
motion. Since the force of friction arises
due to contact between sur faces, it is
also an example of a contact for
ce. You
will learn more about this force in
Chapter 12.
You may be wondering whether it is
essential for the agent applying a forceon an object to be always in contact with
it. Let us find out.
11.7 Non-contact Forces
Magnetic Force
Activity 11.6
Take a pair of bar magnets. Place
the longer side of one of the magnets
over three round shaped pencils or
wooden rollers as shown in
Fig.11.10. Now bring one end of the
other magnet near the end of the
magnet placed on the rollers. Make
sure that the two magnets do not
touch each other . Observe what
happens. Next, bring the other end
of the magnet near the same end of
the magnet placed on the rollers
(Fig.11.10). Note what happens to
the magnet placed on the rollers
every time another magnet is
brought near it.

SCIENCE 136 Fig.11.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts
another straw but repels it if it has
also been rubbed with a sheet of
paper
A straw is said to have acquired
electrostatic charge after it has been
rubbed with a sheet of paper . Such a
straw is an example of a charged body.
The force exerted by a charged body
on another charged or uncharged body
is known as electrostatic force . This
force comes into play even when the
bodies are not in contact. The
electrostatic force, therefore, is another
example of a non-contact for ce. You will
learn more about electric charges in
Chapter 15.
Gravitational Force
You know that a coin or a pen falls to the
ground when it slips off your hand.
L
eaves and fruits also fall to the ground
when they get detached from the plant.
Have you ever wondered why it is so?
When the coin is held in your hand it
is at rest. As soon as it is released, it
begins to move downwards. It is clear that
the state of motion of the coin undergoes
a change. Can this happen without a
force acting on it?  Which is this force?Does the magnet on the rollers begin
to move when the other magnet is brought
near it? Does it always move in the
direction of the approaching magnet?
What do these observations suggest? Does
it mean that some force must be acting
between the two magnets?
You have lear nt in Class VI that like
poles of two magnets repel each other and
unlike poles attract each other . Attraction
or repulsion between objects can also be
seen as another form of pull or push. Do
you have to bring the magnets in contact
for observing the force between them? A
magnet can exert a force on another
magnet without being in contact with it.
The force exerted by a magnet is an
example of a non-contact force .
Similarly, the force exerted by a
magnet on a piece of iron is also a non-
contact force.
Electrostatic Force
Activity 11.7
Take a plastic straw and cut it into
nearly two equal pieces. Suspend one
of the pieces from the edge of a table
with the help of a piece of thread (Fig.
11.11). Now hold the other piece of
straw in your hand and rub its free
end with a sheet of paper . Bring the
rubbed end of the straw near the
suspended straw. Make sure that the
two pieces do not touch each other .
What do you observe?
Next, rub the free end of the
suspended piece of straw with a
sheet of paper . Again, bring the piece
of straw that was rubbed earlier with
paper near the free end of the
suspended straw. What do you
observe now?

FORCE AND PRESSURE 137Objects or things fall towards the
earth because it pulls them. This force
is called the force of gravity , or just
gravity . This is an attractive force. The
force of gravity acts on all objects. The
force of gravity acts on all of us all the
time without our being awar e of it. W ater
begins to flow towards the ground as
soon as we open a tap. W ater in rivers
flows downward due to the force of
gravity.Try cutting vegetables with a blunt
knife  and then with a sharp knife. Which
is easier?
Do you get the feeling that the area
over which the force is applied (for
example, the pointed end of the nail)
plays  a role in making these tasks easier?
The force acting on a unit area of a
surface is called 
pressure.
pressure = force / area on which it acts
At this stage we consider only those
forces which act perpendicular to the
surface on which the pressure is to
be computed.Gravity is not a property of the earth
alone. In fact, every object in the
universe, whether small or large,
exerts a force on every other object.
This force is known as the
gravitational force .

You have lear nt in Class VII that str ong
winds during a storm or a cyclone can
blow away even the r oof-tops. Y ou also
learnt that winds and cyclones are
caused by the differences in air
pressure. Is there any relation between
pressure and force? Let us find out.
Try to push a nail into a wooden
plank by its head. Did you succeed? T ry
now to push the nail by the pointed end
(Fig. 11.12). Could you do it this time?
I now understand why
porters place a round piece
of cloth on their heads,
when they have to carry
heavy loads (Fig. 11.13). By
doing this they increase the
area of contact of the load
with their head. So, the
pressure on their head is
reduced and they find it
easier to carry the load.

SCIENCE 138Note that the area is in the
denominator in the above expression.
So, the smaller the area, larger the
pressur e on a sur face for the same for ce.
The area of the pointed end of the nail
is much smaller than that of its head.
The same force, therefore, produces a
pressure sufficient to push the pointed
end of the nail into the wooden plank.
Can you explain now why shoulder
bags are provided with broad straps and
not thin strap? And, why the tools
meant for cutting and piercing always
have sharp edges?
Do liquids and gases also exert
pressure? Does it also depend on the
area on which the force acts?  Let us
find out.

Take a transparent glass tube or a
plastic pipe. The length of the pipe/
tube should be about 25 cm and its
diameter should be 5-7.5 cm. Also
take a piece of thin sheet of a good
quality rubber , say, a rubber
balloon. Stretch the rubber sheet
tightly over one end of the pipe.
Hold the pipe at the middle, keeping
it in a vertical position (Fig.11.14).
Ask one of your friends to pour some
water in the pipe. Does the rubber

height of the water column in the
pipe. Pour some mor e water .
Observe again the bulge in the
rubber sheet and the height of the
water column in the pipe. Repeatthis process a few more times. Can
you see any relation between the

say that air exerts pressure in all
directions?
Do you recall what happens to the
air in the bicycle tube when it has a
puncture? Do these observations suggest
that air exerts pressure on the inner walls
of an inflated balloon or a  tube? So, we
find that gases, too, exert pressure on
the walls of their container .
11.10 Atmospheric Pressure
You know that ther e is air all ar ound
us. This envelop of air is known as the
atmosphere . The atmospheric air
extends up to many kilometres above
the sur face of the earth. The pr essure
exerted by this air is known as
atmospheric pr essur
e. We know that
pressure is force per unit area. If we
imagine a unit area and a very long
cylinder standing on it filled with air ,
then the force of gravity on the air in
this cylinder is the atmospheric
pressure (Fig. 11.17).
Fig.11.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a
surface
When you pr ess the sucker , most of
the air between its cup and the sur face
escapes out. The sucker sticks to the
surface because the pr essur e of
atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker
off the sur face, the applied for ce should
be large enough to overcome the
atmospheric pressure. This activity
might give you an idea about the
magnitude of atmospheric pressure. In
fact, it would not be possible for any
human being to pull the sucker off the
But, how large or small is the
atmospheric pressure? Let us get an
idea about its magnitude.
Activity 11.11
Take a good quality rubber sucker .
It looks like a small rubber cup (Fig.

FORCE AND PRESSURE 141
If the area of my head
were 15 cm × 15 cm, how
much force air will exert
on my head?
Fig. 11.19 : Pressure of atmosphere on
your headsurface if ther e wer e no air at all between
the sucker and the sur face. Does it give
you an idea how large the atmospheric
pressure is?
The force due to air in a column of
the height of the atmosphere and area
15 cm × 15 cm (Fig. 11.19) is nearly
equal to the force of gravity on an object
of mass 225 kg (2250N). The reason we
are not crushed under this force of
gravity is that the pressure inside our
bodies is also equal to the atmospheric
pressure and balances the pressure from
outside.
Did you know?
Otto von Guericke, a German scientist of the 17th century, invented a pump to
extract air out of a vessel. With the help of this pump, he demonstrated
dramatically the force of the air pressure. He joined two hollow metallic
hemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and pumped air out of them. Then he
employed eight horses on each hemisphere to pull them apart (Fig. 11.20). So
great is the force of air pressure that the hemispheres could not be pulled apart.

1.Make a 50 cm × 50 cm bed of dry sand about 10 cm in thickness.
Make sure that its top surface is levelled. Take a wooden or a plastic
stool. Cut two strips of graph paper each with a width of 1 cm.
Paste them vertically on any leg of the stool - one at the bottom and
the other from the top.  Now gently put the stool on the sand bed
with its legs resting on the sand. Increase the size of sand bed if
required. Now put a load, say a school bag full of books, on the seat
of the stool. Mark the level of sand on the graph strip. This would
give you the depth, if any, to which the legs of stool sink in sand.
Next, turn the stool upside down so that now it rests on its seat on
the sand bed. Note the depth to which the stool sinks now. Next,
put the same load on the stool and note the depth to which it sinks
in the sand. Compare the pressure exerted by the stool in the two
situations.
2.Take a tumbler and fill it with water . Cover the mouth of the tumbler
with a thick card similar to that of a postcard. Hold the tumbler

You saw that if you apply the for ce
along the left, friction acts along the
right. If you apply the force along the
right, the friction acts along the left
direction. In both cases the force opposes
the motion of the book. The force of
friction always opposes the applied force.
In the above activity, the force of
friction acts between the sur face of the

Is the  friction the same for all the

Tie a string ar ound a brick. Pull the
brick by a spring balance (Fig.

Note down the reading on the
spring balance when the brick just

Now wrap a piece of polythene

difference in the readings of the
spring balance in the above two
cases? What might be the reasonSpring Balance
Spring balance is a device used for
measuring the force acting on an
object. It consists of a coiled spring
which gets stretched when a force is
applied to it. Stretching of the spring
is measured by a pointer moving on
a graduated scale. The reading on the
scale gives the magnitude of the force.

result.Fig. 12.4 : The pencil cell covers different
distances on different surfacesI shall try the activity
by wrapping a piece of
sandpaper around

Friction is caused by the
irregularities on the two sur faces in
contact. Even those sur faces which
appear very smooth have a large number
of minute irregularities on them (Fig.
12.5). Irr egularities on the two sur faces
lock into one another . When we attempt
to move any sur face, we have to apply a
force to overcome interlocking. On
rough sur faces, ther e are a lar ger
number of irregularities. So the force of
friction is gr eater if a r ough sur face is
involved.Mark A

12.3 Friction : A Necessary
Evil
Recall now some of your experiences. Is
it easier to hold a 
kulhar (earthen pot)
or a glass tumbler? Suppose the outer
surface of the tumbler is greasy, or has
a thin layer of cooking oil on it; would it
become easier or more difficult to hold
it? Just think : would it be possible to
hold the glass at all if there is no
friction?
Recall also how difficult it is to move
on a wet muddy track, or wet marble
floor. Can you imagine being able to walk
at all if there were no friction?
You could not write with pen or
pencil if there were no friction.  When
your teacher is writing with chalk on
the blackboard, its r ough sur face rubs
off some chalk particles which stick to Recall your experience when last time
you moved a heavy box from one place
to another (Fig. 12.6). If you have no
such experience, get that experience
now. What is easier — to move the box
from rest, or to move it when it is already
in motion?
The force required to overcome
friction at the instant an object starts
moving from rest is a measure of static
friction. On the other hand, the force
required to keep the object moving with
the same speed is a measure of sliding
friction.
When the box starts sliding, the
contact points on its sur face, do not get
enough time to lock into the contact
points on the floor . So, the sliding
friction is slightly smaller than the staticFig. 12.7 : A nail is fixed in the wall due to

the black board. Could it happen if there
were no friction between the chalk and
the board?
If an object started moving, it would
never stop if there were no friction. Had
there been no friction between the tyres
of the automobiles and the road, they
could not be started or stopped or
turned to change the direction of
motion. Y ou could not fix a nail on the
wall (Fig. 12.7) or tie a knot. Without
friction no building could be constructed.

On the other hand, friction is an evil,

they are screws, ball bearings or soles
of shoes (Fig. 12.8). Y ou must have seen
worn-out steps of foot over -bridges at
railway stations.

12.4 Increasing and Reducing
Friction
As you have seen in the previous section,
friction is desirable in some situations.
Have you ever thought why the sole
of your shoe is grooved [Fig. 12.11 (a)]?
It is done to provide the shoes better
grip on the floor , so that you can move
safely. Similarly, the treaded tyres of
cars,trucks and bulldozers provide better
grip with the ground.In some situations, however , friction
is undesirable and we would want to
minimise it.
Why do you sprinkle fine powder on
the carr om boar d (Fig. 12.12)? Y ou might
have noticed that when a few drops of
oil ar e pour ed on the hinges of a door,
the door moves smoothly. A bicycle and
a motor mechanic uses grease between
the moving parts of these machines. In
all the above cases, we want to reduce

board to reduce friction
friction in order to increase efficiency.
When oil, grease or graphite is applied
between the moving part of a machine,
a thin layer is formed there and moving
surfaces do not dir ectly rub against each
other (Fig. 12.13). Interlocking of
irregularities is avoided to a great extent.
Movement becomes smooth. The
substances which reduce friction are
called lubricants . In some machines, it
may not be advisable to use oil as
lubricant. An air cushion between the
moving parts is used to reduce friction.We deliberately incr ease friction by
using brake pads in the brake system
of bicycles and automobiles. When you
are riding a bicycle, the brake pads do
not touch the wheels. But when you
press the brake lever , these pads arr est
the motion of  the rim due to friction.
The wheel stops moving. Y
ou might have
seen that kabaddi  players rub their
hands with soil for a better grip of their
opponents. Gymnasts apply some coarse
substance on their hands to increase
friction for better grip.(a) (b)

12.15). Now push the book. Y ou
observe the pencils rolling as the
book moves. Do you feel it easier to
move the book in this way than to
slide it? Do you think that
resistance to the motion of the book
has been reduced? Have you seen
heavy machinary being moved by
placing logs under it?
12.5 Wheels Reduce Friction
You must have seen attaches and other
pieces of luggage fitted with rollers. Even
a child can pull such pieces of luggage
(Fig. 12.14). Why is it so? Let us find
out.Can we reduce friction to
zero by polishing surfaces
or using large amount of
lubricants?
Friction can never be
entirely eleminated. No
surface is perfectly smooth.
Some irregularities are
always there.
Fig. 12.15 : Motion of the book on rollers
When one body r olls over the sur face
of another body, the resistance to its
motion is called rolling friction . Rolling
reduces friction. It is always easier to
roll than to slide a body over another .
That is the reason it is convenient to
pull luggage fitted with rollers. Can you
now understand why the wheel is said
to be one of the greatest inventions of
mankind?
Since the rolling friction is smaller
than the sliding friction , sliding is
replaced in most machines by rolling
by the use of ball bearings. Common
examples are the use of ball bearings
between hubs and the axles of ceiling
fans and bicycles (Fig. 12.16). Fig. 12.14 : Rolling reduces friction

FRICTION 153
12.6 Fluid Friction
You know that air is very light and thin.
Yet it exerts frictional for ce on objects
moving through it. Similarly, water and
other liquids exert force of friction when
objects move through them. In science,
the common name of gases and liquidsis 
fluids. So we can say that fluids exert
force of friction on objects in motion
through them.
The frictional force exerted by fluids
is also called drag.
The frictional force on an object in a
fluid depends on its speed with respect
to the fluid. The frictional force also
depends on the shape of the object and
the nature of the fluid.
It is obvious that when objects move
through fluids, they have to overcome
friction acting on them. In this process
they lose energy. Efforts are, therefore,
made to minimise friction. So, objects
are given special shapes. Where do you
think scientists get hints for these
special shapes? From nature, of course.
Birds and fishes have to move about in
fluids all the time. Their bodies must
have evolved to shapes which would
make them lose less energy in
overcoming friction. Y ou read about
these shapes in Class VI. Look carefully
at the shape of an aeroplane (Fig. 12.17).
Do you find any similarity in its shape
and that of a bird? In fact, all vehicles
are designed to have shapes which
reduce fluid friction.

SOUNDSOUND
How do you come to know that a
‘period’ is over in your school?
You come to know easily that
someone is at your door when he knocks
or you hear the sound of the doorbell.
Most of the time you can make out that
someone is approaching you by just
hearing the foot steps.
You might have played a game called
hide and seek. In this game a person is
blind-folded and has to catch the
remaining players. How is the blind-
folded person able to guess which player
is closest to her?Sound plays an important role in our
lives. It helps us to communicate with
one another . We hear a variety of sounds
in our surroundings.
Make a list of sounds you hear in
your surroundings.
In the music room of your school you
hear the sound s
 produced by musical
instruments like flute, tabla ,
harmonium, etc. (Fig 13.1).
How is sound produced? How does it

SCIENCE 15813.1 Sound is Produced by a
Vibrating Body
Touch the school bell when not in use.
What do you feel? Again touch it when
producing sound. Can you feel it
vibrating?
Activity 13.1
Take a metal plate (or a pan). Hang
it at a convenient place in such a
way that it does not touch any wall.
Now strike it with a stick (Fig.13.2).
Do you hear a sound? Touch the
plate or pan gently with your finger .
Do you feel the vibrations?
Fig. 13.2 : Striking a pan
Again strike the plate with the stick
and hold it tightly with your hands
immediately after striking. Do you
still hear the sound?  Touch the
plate after it stops producing sound.
Can you feel the vibrations now?As you learnt in Class VII the to and
fro or back and forth motion of an
object is called vibration . When a
tightly stretched band is plucked, it
vibrates and produces sound. When it
stops vibrating, it does not produce
any sound.
Activity 13.3
Take a metal dish. Pour water in it.
Strike it at its edge with a spoon
(Fig. 13.4). Do you hear a sound?
Again strike the dish and then
touch it. Can you feel the dish
vibrating? Strike the dish again.
Look at the sur face of water . Do you
see any waves there? Now hold the
dish. What change do you observe
on the sur face of water? Can you
explain the change? Is there a hint
to connect sound with the
vibrations of a body?

produces sound. In some cases, the
vibrations are easily visible to us. But
in most cases, their amplitude is so small
that we cannot see them. However , we
can feel them.

13.2 Sound Produced by
Humans
Speak loudly for a while or sing a song,
or buzz like a bee. Put your hand on
your throat as shown in Fig. 13.8. Do
you feel any vibrations?
In humans, the sound is produced
by the voice box  or the larynx . Put your
fingers on the throat and find a hard
bump that seems to move when you
swallow. This part of the body is known
as the voice box. It is at the upper end
of the windpipe . Two vocal cords,
 are
stretched across the voice box or larynx
in such a way that it leaves a narrow
slit between them for the passage of air
(Fig.13.8).
Fig. 13.7 :  Jaltrang
When we pluck the string of an
instrument, like the sitar , the sound
that we hear is not only that of the
string. The whole instrument is forced
to vibrate, and it is the sound of the
vibration of the instrument that we
hear. Similarly, when we strike the
membrane of a mridangam
, the sound
that we hear is not only that of the
membrane but of the whole body of
the instrument.When we speak, does
any part of our body
vibrate?
Fig.13.8 : Voice box in humans
When the lungs force air through the
slit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing
sound. Muscles attached to the vocal
cords can make the cords tight or loose.
When the vocal cords are tight and thin,
the type or quality of voice is differentActivity 13.5
Take 6-8 bowls or tumblers. Fill
them with water up to  different
levels, increasing gradually from
one end to the other . Now take
a  pencil and strike the bowls gently.
Strike all of them in succession. Y ou
will hear pleasant sounds. This is
your jaltrang  (Fig.13.7).

SOUND 161from that when they are loose and
thick. Let us see how the vocal cords
function.
Activity 13.6
Take two rubber strips of the same
size. Place these two pieces one
above the other and stretch them
tight. Now blow air through the gap
between them [Fig. 13.9(a)]. As the
air blows through the stretched
rubber strips, a sound is produced.
You can also take a piece of paper
with a narrow slit and hold it
between your fingers as shown in
Fig. 13.9 (b). Now blow through the
slit and listen to the sound. Our
vocal cords produce sound in a
similar manner .
(a)
(b)
Fig. 13.9 (a), (b) : Working of vocal cor ds
The vocal cords in men are about
20 mm long. In women these are about
15mm long. Children have very short
vocal cords. This is the reason why
the voices of men, women and
children are different.
13.3 Sound Needs a Medium
for Propagation
When you call up your friend who is
standing at a distance, your friend is
able to hear your voice. How does the
sound propagate or  travel to her?
Activity 13.7
Take a metal  or glass tumbler . Make
sure that it is dry. Place a cell phone
in it. (Remember that the cell phone
must not be kept in water .) Ask your
friend to give a ring on this cell
phone from another cell phone.
Listen to the ring carefully.
Now, surround the rim of the
tumbler with your hands (Fig.

opening between your hands.
Indicate to your friend to give a ring
again. Listen to the ring while
sucking air fr om the tumbler .
Does the sound become fainter
as you suck air?
Remove the tumbler from your
mouth. Does the sound become
loud again?
Can you think of an explanation? Is
it possible that the decreasing amount
of air in the tumbler had something to
do with decreasing loudness  of the ring?
Indeed, if you had been able to suck
all the air in the tumbler , you will not
listen any sound . Actually, sound needs
a medium to travel. When air has been
removed completely from a vessel, it is said
that there is  a vacuum in the vessel. The
sound  cannot travel through
 a vacuum.
Does sound travel in liquids? Let us
find out.
Activity 13.8
Take a bucket or a bathtub. Fill it
with clean water . Take a small bell
in one hand. Shake this bell inside
the water to produce sound. Make
sure that the bell does not touch
the body of the bucket or the tub.Oh ! That is how whales
and dolphins might be
communicating under
water .

rod and hold its one end to your
ear. Ask your friend to gently
scratch or tap at the other end of
the scale (Fig. 13.12).

SOUND 163You can also per form the above
activity by placing your ear at one end
of a long wooden or metallic table and
asking your friend to gently scratch the
other end of the table (Fig. 13.13).
Fig. 13.13 :  Sound can travel through solids
We find that sound can travel
through wood or metal. In fact, sound
can travel thr ough any solid. Y ou can
perform inter esting activities to show
that sound can also travel through
strings. Have you ever made a toy
telephone (Fig. 13.14). Can you say that
sound can travel through strings?
Fig. 13.14 : A toy telephone
We have lear nt so far that vibrating
objects produce sound and it is carried
in all directions in a medium. The
medium could be a gas, a liquid or a
solid. How do we hear it?
Fig. 13.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum13.4 We Hear Sound thr ough
Our Ears
The shape of the outer part of the ear is
like a funnel. When sound enters it, it
travels down a canal at the end of which
there is a thin stretched membrane. It
is called the eardrum. It per forms an
important function. To understand what
the eardrum does, let us build a tin-can
model of the eardrum.
Activity 13.10
Take a plastic or tin-can. Cut its
ends. Stretch a piece of rubber
balloon across one end of the can
and fasten it with a rubber band.
Put four or five grains of dry cereal
on the str etched rubber . Now ask
your friend to speak “Hurrey,
Hurrey” from the open end
(Fig.13.15). Observe what  happens
to the grain. Why do the grains
jump up and down?
2018-19


SCIENCE 164The eardrum is like a stretched
rubber sheet. Sound vibrations make
the eardrum vibrate (Fig. 13.16). The
eardrum sends vibrations to the inner
ear. From ther e, the signal goes to the
brain. That is how we hear .You have alr eady lear nt in earlier classes
about the oscillatory motion and its
time period .
The number of oscillations  per
second is called the 
frequency  of
oscillation. Frequency is expressed in
hertz. Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of
1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an
object oscillates 20 times in one second,
what would be its frequency?
You can r ecognise many familiar
sounds without seeing the objects
producing them. How is it possible?
These sounds must be different to
enable you to recognise them. Have you
ever thought what factors make them
different?  Amplitude  and frequency are
two important properties of any sound.
Can we differentiate sounds on the basis
of their amplitudes and frequencies?
Loudness and Pitch
Activity 13.11
Take a metallic tumbler and a
tablespoon. Strike the tablespoon
gently at the brim of the tumbler .Fig. 13.16 : Human ear
Fig. 13.17 : Thermocol ball touching the
vibrating glass tumblerWe must NEVER put a sharp,
pointed or hard thing into our
ear. It can damage the
eardrum. The damaged
eardrum can impair hearing.
13.5 Amplitude, T ime Period

Vibration
We have lear nt that the to and fr o motion
of an object is known as vibration. This
motion is also called oscillatory motion .Eardrum
Inner ear
2018-19


SOUND 165Hear the sound produced. Now bang
the spoon on the tumbler and hear
the sound produced again. Is the
sound louder when the tumbler is
struck hard?
Now suspend a small thermocol
ball touching the rim of the tumbler
(Fig. 13.17). Vibrate the tumbler by
striking it. See how far the ball is
displaced. The displacement of the
ball is a measure of the amplitude
of vibration of the tumbler .
Now, strike the tumbler gently
and then a little har der. Compar e
the amplitudes of vibrations of the
tumbler in the two cases. In which
case is the amplitude larger?
Loudness of sound is proportional to
the square of the amplitude of the
vibration producing the sound. For
example, if the amplitude becomes
twice, the loudness increases by a
factor of 4. The loudness is expressed
in a unit called decibel (dB). The
following table gives some idea of the
loudness of sound coming from
various sources.
Normal breathing 10 dB
Soft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB
Normal conversation 60 dB
Busy traffic 70 dB
Average factory 80 dB
Above 80 dB the noise becomes
physically painful.I wonder why my voice
is different from that of
my teacher .
Compare the sound of a baby with
that of an adult. Is there any difference?
Even if two sounds are equally loud,
they differ in some way. Let us see how.
Fig. 13.18 : Frequency determines the
pitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on
its amplitude. When the amplitude of
vibration is large, the sound produced
is loud. When the amplitude is small,
the sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the
shrillness  or pitch
 of a sound. If the
frequency of vibration is higher we say
that the sound is shrill and has a higher
pitch. If the frequency of vibration is
lower , we say that the sound has a lower
pitch. For example, a drum vibrates with
a low frequency. Therefore, it produces
2018-19


SCIENCE 166a low-pitched sound. On the other
hand, a whistle has a high frequency
and therefore, produces a sound of
higher pitch (Fig. 13.18). A bird makes
a high-pitched sound whereas a lion
makes a low-pitched r oar. However , the
roar of a lion is very loud while the
sound of the bird is quite feeble.
Every day you hear the voices of
children and adults. Do you find any
difference in their voices? Can you say
that the frequency of the voice of a child
is higher than that of an adult?
Usually the voice of a woman has
a higher  frequency than that of a
man.
13.6 Audible and Inaudible
Sounds
We know that we need a vibrating body
for the production of sound. Can we
hear the sound of all vibrating bodies?
The fact is that sounds of frequencies
less than about 20 vibrations per second
(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human
ear. Such sounds ar e called ina u
dible.
On the higher side, sounds of  frequencies
higher than about 20,000 vibrations per
second (20 kHz) are also not audible to
the  human ear . Thus, for human ear ,
the range of audible frequencies is
roughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.
Some animals can hear sounds of
frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.
Dogs have this ability. The police use
high frequency whistles which dogs can
hear but humans cannot.
The ultrasound equipment, familiar
to us for investigating and tracking
many medical problems, works at
frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.13.7 Noise and Music
We hear dif ferent types of sounds
around us. Is the sound always
pleasing? Does a sound sometimes
cause discomfort to you? Some sounds
are pleasant to the ear , wher eas some
are not.
Suppose construction work is going
on in your neighbourhood. Are the
sounds coming from the construction
site pleasin g? Do you enjoy the sounds
produced by horns of buses and trucks?
Such unpleasant sounds are called
noise . In a classroom, if all the students
speak together , what would the sound
produced be called?
On the other hand you enjoy sounds
from musical instruments.  Musical
sound is one which is pleasing to the
ear. Sound produced by a har
monium
is a musical sound. The string of a sitar
also gives out a musical sound.  But, if
a musical sound becomes too loud,
would it remain melodious ?
13.8 Noise Pollution
You alr eady know about air pollution.
Presence of unwanted gases and
particles in air is called air pollution.
Similarly, presence of excessive or
unwanted sounds in the environment
is called noise pollution. Can you list
some sources of noise pollution? Major
causes of noise pollution are sounds of
vehicles, explosions including bursting
of crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.
What sources in the home may lead to
noise? Television and transistor radio
at high volumes, some kitchen
appliances, desert coolers, air
conditioners, all contribute to noise
pollution.
2018-19


SOUND 167Hearing Impairment
Total hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial
disability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with
impaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children
can communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of
hearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also.
Technological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such
persons to improve their quality of life. S ociety can do much to  improve the
living environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise
Pollution?
Do you know that presence of excessive
noise in the surroundings may cause
many health related problems. Lack of
sleep, hypertension (high blood-
pressure), anxiety and many more health
disorders may be caused by noise
pollution. A person who is exposed to a
loud sound continuously may get
temporary or even permanent
impairment of hearing.
Measures to Limit Noise Pollution
To control noise, we  must control the
sources of noise. How can this be
achieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air  craft engines,
transport vehicles, industrial
machines and home appliances.
How can the noise pollution be
controlled in a residential area?
All noisy operations must be
conducted away from any residential
area. Noise producing industries
should be set up away from such
areas. Use of automobile horns
should be minimi s
ed. TV and music
systems should be run at low
volumes. Trees must be planted along
the roads and around buildings to
cut down on the sounds reaching the
residents, thus reducing the harmful
effects of noise pollution.

Golconda fortDid Y ou Know?
Golconda fort, near Hyderabad, is one of the most magnificient
forts in India. It is famous for many engineering and architectural
marvels. One of the marvels is the water supply system. But,
perhaps, more astonishing is a dome near the entrance to the fort.
A hand-clap at a particular point under the dome reverberates
and can be heard at the highest point of the fort, about a kilometre
away. This was devised as a warning system. If a guard saw a
suspicious movement outside the fort, he clapped at the particular
point under the dome, and the army inside the fort was alerted to
the danger of the approaching enemy.

CHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC
CURRENTCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC
CURRENT
Your elders might have cautioned
you against touching an electrical
appliance with wet hands. But
do you know why it is dangerous to
touch an electrical appliance with wet
hands?
We have lear nt earlier that the
materials, which allow electric current
to pass through them, are good
conductors of electricity. On the other
hand, materials, which do not allow
electric current to pass through them
easily, are poor conductors of electricity.
In Class VI, we made a tester  to test
whether a particular material allows the
electric current to pass through it or not.
Do you recall how the tester helped us
in deciding that?
We found that metals such as copper
and aluminium conduct electricity
wher eas materials such as rubber ,plastic and wood do not conduct
electricity. However , so far we have used
our tester to test materials which were
in solid state. But what about liquids?
Do liquids also conduct electricity? Let
us find out.
Paheli and Boojho want to
remind you that one
should not experiment
with the electric supply
from the mains or a
generator or an inverter .
Use only electric cells for
all the activities suggested
here.
Fig.14.1 :  A tester14.1 Do Liquids Conduct
Electricity?
To test whether a liquid allows electric
current to pass through it or not, we
can use the same tester (Fig .14.1).
2018-19


However , replace the cell by a battery.
Also, before using the tester we
should check whether it is working
or not.
Activity 14.1
Join the free ends of the tester
together for a moment. This
completes the circuit of the tester
and the bulb should glow.  However ,
if the bulb does not glow, it means
that the tester is not working. Can
you think of the possible reasons?
Is it possible that the connections
are loose? Or , the bulb is fused? Or ,
your cells are used up? Check that
all the connections are tight. If they
are, then replace the bulb with
another bulb. Now test if the tester
is working or not. If it is still not
working then replace the cells with
fresh cells.
Now that our tester is working, let
us use it to test the various liquids.
(Caution: While checking your tester ,
do not join its free ends for more than a
few seconds. Otherwise the cells of the
battery will drain very quickly. )
Activity 14.2
Collect a few small plastic or rubber
caps of discarded bottles and clean
them. Pour one teaspoon of lemon
juice or vinegar in one cap. Bring
your tester over this cap and let the
ends of the tester dip into lemon juice
or vinegar as shown in Fig.14.2. Take
care that the ends are not more than
1 cm apart but at the same time do
not touch each other . Does the bulbFig. 14.2 :  Testing conduction of electricity in
lemon juice or vinegarof the tester glow? Does lemon juice
or vinegar conduct electricity? How
would you classify lemon juice or
vinegar — a good conductor or a poor
conductor?
When the liquid between the two
ends of the tester allows the electric
current to pass, the circuit of the tester
becomes complete. The current flows in
the circuit and the bulb glows. When
the liquid does not allow the electric
current to pass, the circuit of the tester
is not complete and the bulb does not
glow.
In some situations  even though the
liquid is conducting, the bulb may not
glow. It may have happened in Activity
14.2. What can be the reason?
Do you remember why the bulb
glows when the electric current passes
through it? Due to the heating effect
of current, the filament of the bulb gets
heated to a high temperature and it
starts glowing. However
, if the current
through a circuit is too weak, the
filament does not get heated

SCIENCE 174Activity 14.3
Take the tray from inside a discarded
matchbox. W rap an electric wir e a few
times around the tray. Place a small
compass needle inside it. Now
connect one free end of the wire to
the terminal of a battery. Leave the
other end free. Take another piece of
wire and connect it to the other
terminal of the battery (Fig. 14.4).
Fig 14.4 :  Another testersufficiently and it does not glow. And
why is the current in the circuit weak?
Well, though a material may conduct
electricity, it may not conduct it as
easily as a metal. As a result, the
circuit of the tester may be complete
and yet the current through it may be
too weak to make the bulb glow. Can
we make another tester which can
detect a weak current?
We can use another ef fect of an electric
current to make another kind of tester .
Do you recall that electric current
produces a magnetic effect? What
happens to a compass needle kept nearby
when current flows in a wire? Even if
the current is small, the deflection of the
magnetic needle can be seen. Can we
make a tester using the magnetic
effect of currents? Let us find out  in
Activity 14.3 .
Join the free ends of two wires
momentarily. The compass needle
should show deflection .
 Your tester
with two free ends of the wire is ready.
Now repeat Activity 14.2 using this
tester . Do you find a deflection in the
compass needle the moment you dip
the free ends of the tester in lemon
juice?
Take out the ends of the tester
from the lemon juice, dip them in
water and then wipe them dry.
Repeat the activity with other liquids
such as tap water , vegetable oil, milk,
honey. (Remember to wash and wipe
dry the ends of tester after testing
each liquid).  In each case observe
whether the magnetic needle shows
deflection or not. Record your
observations in Table 14.1.
You may use an LED (Fig. 14.3) in
place of the electric bulb in the tester
of Fig. 14.2. LED glows even when a
weak electric current flows through
it.
There are two wires (called leads)
attached to an LED. One lead is
slightly longer than the other .
Remember that while connecting to
a circuit, the longer lead is always
connected to the positive terminal of
the battery and the shorter lead is
connected to the negative terminal of
the battery.

When the free ends of the
tester do not touch each
other , ther e is an air gap
between them. Paheli knows
that air is a poor conductor of
electricity. But she has also read
that during lightning, an electric
current passes thr ough air . She
wonders if air is indeed a poor
conductor under all conditions.
This makes Boojho ask whether
other materials classified as
poor conductors also allow
electricity to pass under
certain conditions.
From Table 14.1, we find that some
liquids are good conductors of electricity
and some are poor conductors.
Actually, under certain conditions
most materials can conduct. That is why
it is preferable to classify materials as
good conductors and poor conductors
instead of classifying as conductors and
insulators.We have tested the conduction of
electricity thr ough tap water . Let us now
test the conduction of electricity through
distilled water .
Activity 14.4
Take about two teaspoonfuls of
distilled water in a clean and dry
plastic or rubber cap of a bottle. (You
may obtain distilled water from your
school science lab. Y ou may also get
distilled water from a medical store
or a doctor or a nurse) . Use the tester
to test whether distilled water
conducts electricity or not. What do
you find? Does distilled water
conduct electricity? Now dissolve a
pinch of common salt in distilled
water . Again test. What do you
conclude this time?
When salt is dissolved in distilled
water , we obtain salt solution. This is a
conductor of electricity.
The water that we get from sources
such as taps, hand pumps, wells  and
ponds is not pure. It may contain several
2018-19


SCIENCE 176salts dissolved in it. Small amounts of
mineral salts are naturally present in it.
This water is thus a good conductor of
electricity. On the other hand, distilled
water is free of salts and is a poor
conductor .Most liquids that conduct electricity
are solutions of acids, bases and salts.
When an electric current flows
through a conducting solution, does it
produce an effect on the solution?
14.2 Chemical Ef fects of
Electric Current
In Class VII, we have learnt some effects
of electric current. Can you list these
effects? What effect does the current
produce when it flows through a
conducting solution? Let us find out.
Activity 14.6
Take out carbon rods carefully from
two discarded cells. Clean their
metal caps with sand paper . Wrap
copper  wires around the metal caps
of the carbon rod s and join them to
a battery (Fig. 14.5). W e call these
two rods electrodes . (Instead ofSmall amounts of mineral salts
present naturally in water are
beneficial for human health.
However , these salts make water
a good conductor . So, we should
never handle electrical
appliances with wet hands or
while standing on a wet floor .
We have found that common salt , when
dissolved in distilled water , makes it a good
conductor . What ar e the other substances
which, when dissolved in distilled water ,
make it conducting? Let us find out.
Caution: Do the next activity under the
supervision of your teacher/parent or
some elderly person, because the use of
acid is involved in it.
Activity 14.5
Take three clean plastic or rubber caps
of bottles. Pour about two teaspoonfuls
of distilled water in each of them. Add
a few drops of lemon juice or dilute
hydrochloric acid to distilled water in
one cap. Now in the second cap
containing distilled water , add a few
drops of a base such as caustic soda
or potassium iodide. Add a little sugar
to the distilled water in the third cap
and dissolve it. Test which solutions
conduct electricity and which do not.

CHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 177Boojho decided to test
whether some fruits and
vegetables also conduct
electricity or not. He cut
a potato into two halves and
inserted the copper wires of a tester
into it. Just then his mother called
him and he forgot to take out the
wires of the tester inserted into the
potato. When he came back after
half an hour , he noticed that ther e
was a greenish blue spot on the
potato around one wire whereas
there was no such spot around the
other wire (Fig. 14.6).carbon  rods, you may take two iron
nails about 6 cm lon g.) Pour a
cupful of water in a glass/plastic
bowl. Add a teaspoonful of salt or a
few drops of lemon juice to water to
make it more conducting.  Now
immerse the electrodes in this
solution. Make sure that the metal
caps of the carbon rods are outside
the water . Wait for 3-4 minute s.
Observe the electrodes carefully. Do
you notice any gas bubbles near the
electrodes? Can we  call the change
taking place in the solution a
chemical change? Recall the
definition of a chemical change that
you learnt in Class VII.
In 1800, a British chemist, William
Nicholson (1753–1815), had shown
that if electrodes
were immersed
in water , and a
current was passed,
bubbles of oxygen
and hydrogen were
produced. Oxygen
bubbles formed
on the electrode
connected to the positive terminal of
the battery and hydrogen bubbles
formed on the other electrode.
The passage of an electric current
through a conducting solution causes
chemical reactions. As a result, bubbles
of a gas may be formed on the electrodes.
Deposits of metal may be seen on
electrodes. Changes of colour of
solutions may occur . The r eaction would
depend on what solution and electrodes
are used. These are some of the chemical
effects of the electric current.
Fig. 14.6 :  Testing potato
He was surprised with this
observation and along with Paheli
repeated this activity many times. They
found that it was always the wire
connected to the positive terminal,
which had a greenish blue spot around
it. They felt that this discovery was very
useful because it could be used for
identifying the positive terminal of a
cell or a battery  concealed in a box.
They decided to report their finding to
a children’s magazine.

look at them carefully. Do you find
any difference in any one of them?
Do you find a coating over it ? What
colour is the coating ? Note down the
terminal of the battery with which
this electrode is connected.electricity or not. What he found was
that current produced a chemical
effect in the potato. To him this was
very exciting. In fact, this is how
science sometimes works. Y ou ar e
looking for something and you
discover something else. Many
important discoveries have been
made in this manner .
14.3 Electroplating
You know  that a brand new bicycle has
shiny handlebar and wheel rims.
However , if these ar e accidentally
scratched, the shiny coating comes off
revealing a not so shiny sur face beneath.
You might have also seen women using
ornaments, which appear  to be made of
gold. However , with r epeated use, the
gold coating wears off, revealing silver or
some other metal beneath.
In both these cases, a metal has a
coating of another metal. Do you wonder
how a layer of one metal can be
deposited on top of another? W ell, let
us try doing it ourselves.
Activity 14.7
We will need copper sulphate and
two copper plates of size around
10 cm × 4 cm. Take 250 mL of
distilled water in a clean and dry
beaker . Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of
copper sulphate in it. Add a few drops
of dilute sulphuric acid to copper
sulphate solution to make it more
conducting. Clean copper plates with
sand paper . Now rinse them with
water and dry them.  Connect the
copper plate s to the terminals of a
battery 
and immerse them in copper
sulphate solution (Fig. 14.7).When electric current is passed
through the copper sulphate solution,
copper sulphate dissociates into
copper and sulphate. The free copper
gets drawn to the electrode connected
to the negative terminal of the battery
and gets deposited on it.  But what
about the loss of copper from the
solution?
From the other electrode, a
 copper
plate, an equal amount of copper gets
dissolved in the solution. Thus, the
After doing the electroplating
activity, Paheli interchanged
the electrodes and repeated
the activity. What do you think
she would observe this time?

loss of copper from the solution is
restored  and the process continues .
This means that copper gets
transferred from one electrode to the
other .
In the electroplating factories the
disposal of the used conducting
solution is a major concern. It is a
polluting waste and there are specific
disposal guidelines to protect the
environment.Fig. 14.8 :  Some electroplated objects
silver and gold on less expensive metals.
These ornaments have the appearance
of silver or gold but are much less
expensive.
Tin cans, used for storing food, ar e
made by electr oplating tin onto ir on. T in
is less reactive than iron. Thus, food
does not come into contact with iron and
is protected from getting spoilt.
Iron is used in bridges and
automobiles to provide strength.
However , iron tends to corr ode and rust.
So, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron
to  protect it from corrosion and
formation of rust.
Boojho could get only one
copper plate. So he
performed Activity 14.7 by
connecting a carbon rod in
place of the copper plate
which was connected to
the negative terminal of
the battery. He succeeded
in obtaining a coating of
copper on carbon rod.
The process of depositing a layer of
any desired metal on another material
by means of electricity is called
electroplating . It is one of the most
common applications of chemical effects
of electric current.
Electroplating is a very useful
process. It is widely used in industry
for coating metal objects with a thin
layer of a different metal (Fig.14.8). The
layer of metal deposited has some
desired property, which the metal of the
object lacks. For example, chromium
plating is done on many objects such
as car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas
burners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims
and many others.
Chromium has a shiny appearance.
It does not corrode. It resists scratches.
However , chromium is expensive and it
may not be economical to make the
whole object out of chromium. So the
object is made from a cheaper metal and
only a coating of chromium over it is
deposited. Jewellery makers electroplate

You might have seen sparks on a

wires. Y ou might also have seen sparks
when a plug is loose in its socket.
Lightning is also an electric spark, buton a huge scale.
In ancient times, people did not
understand the cause of these sparks.
They were, therefore, afraid of lightning
and thought that the wrath of gods wasvisiting them. Now, of course, weunderstand that lightning is caused bythe accumulation of charges in theclouds. W e need not be afraid of

The Sparks that the Greeks Knew
About
The ancient Greeks knew as early as
600 B.C. that when amber (amber is akind of resin) was rubbed with fur , it
attracted light objects such as hair . You
might have seen that when you takeoff woollen or polyester clothes, yourhair stands on end. If you take off theseclothes in the dark, you even see aspark and hear a crackling sound. In1752 Benjamin Franklin, an Americanscientist, showed that lightning and thespark from your clothes are essentiallythe same phenomena. However , it took
2000 years for this r ealisation to occur .
We shall now study some pr operties
of electric charges. W e shall also see how
2018-19


they are related to the lightning in the
sky.
Let us per form some activities to
understand the nature of electriccharges. But recall first what you mighthave played as a game. When you ruba plastic scale on your dry hair, thescale can attract very small pieces ofpaper .
15.2 Charging by Rubbing

touch the rubbed end of the refillwith your hand or with a metallicobject. Repeat the activity with smallpieces of dry leaf, husk and mustard
seeds. Record your observations.
When a plastic refill is rubbed with
polythene, it acquires a small electriccharge. Similarly, when a plastic combis rubbed with dry hair , it acquir es a
small charge. These objects are calledcharged objects . In the process of
charging the refill and the plastic comb,polythene and hair also get charged.

SCIENCE 18615.3 Types of Charges and
Their Interaction
We will select some objects fr om T able
15.1 for the next activity.
Activity 15.3
(a) Inflate two balloons. Hang them
in such a way that they do not toucheach other (Fig. 15.1). Rub both theballoons with a woollen cloth andrelease them. What do you observe?Rub the other refill also withpolythene. Bring it close to thecharged refill. Be careful not totouch the charged end with yourhand. Is there any effect on the refillin the tumbler? Do the two attracteach other , or r epel each other?
In this activity we have brought
close together the charged objectsthat were made of the samematerial. What happens if twocharged objects made of differentmaterials are brought close to eachother? Let’s find out.(b) Rub a refill and place it gently
in a glass tumbler as before (Fig.15.3). Bring an inflated chargedballoon near the refill and observe.
Fig. 15.1 : Like charges repel each other
Fig. 15.2 : Interaction between like chargesNow let us repeat this activity
with the used pen refills. Rub onerefill with polythene. Place itcarefully in a glass tumbler usingthe tumbler as a stand (Fig. 15.2).
Fig. 15.3 : Unlike charges attract each other
Let’s summarise the observations:
A charged balloon repelled a chargedballoon.
A charged refill repelled a chargedrefill.
But a charged balloon attracted acharged refill.Does it indicate that the charge on
the balloon is of a different kind fromthe charge on the refill? Can we saythen, that there are two kinds of
2018-19


SOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 187charges? Can we also say that the
charges of the same kind repel eachother, while char ges of dif ferent kind
attract each other?
It is a convention to call  the charge
acquired by a glass rod when it isrubbed with silk as positive.  The
other kind of charge is said to benegative.
It is observed that when a charged
glass rod is brought near a chargedplastic straw rubbed with polythenethere is attraction between the two.
What do you think would be the kind
of char ge on the plastic straw? Y our
guess, that the plastic straw would carrya negative charge is correct.
The electrical charges generated by
rubbing are static. They do not move bythemselves. When charges move, theyconstitute an electric current. Y ou have
been reading about electric current sinceClass VI.  The current in a circuit whichmakes a bulb glow, or the current thatmakes a wire hot, is nothing but amotion of charges.
15.4 Transfer of Char ge
Activity 15.4
Take an empty jam bottle. Take apiece of cardboard slightly bigger insize than the mouth of the bottle.Pierce a hole in it so that a metalpaper clip can be inserted. Open outthe paper clip as shown in Fig. 15.4.Cut two strips of aluminium foilabout 4 cm × 1 cm each. Hang themon the paper clip as shown. Insertthe paper clip in the cardboard lidso that it is perpendicular to it (Fig.15.4). Charge a refill and touch it
Fig 15.4 : A simple electroscopewith the end of the paper clip.Observe what happens. Is there anyeffect on the foil strips? Do theyrepel each other or attract eachother? Now, touch other chargedbodies with the end of the paper clip.Do foil strips behave in the sameway in all cases? Can this apparatusbe used to detect whether a body ischarged or not? Can you explainwhy the foil strips repel each other?
The aluminium foil strips receive the
same charge from the charged refillthrough the paper clip (remember thatmetals are good conductors ofelectricity). The strips carrying similarcharges repel each other and theybecome wide open. Such a device canbe used to test whether an object iscarrying charge or not. This device isknown as electroscope .
Thus, we find that electrical charge
can be transferred from a charged objectto another thr ough a metal conductor.
Touch the end of the paper clip gently
with hand and you will find a change in
2018-19


SCIENCE 188the foil strips. They come back to their
original state. Repeat charging of foilstrips and touching the paper clip. Everytime you will find that the foil stripscollapse as soon as you touch thepaperclip  with hand . Why does it
happen? The reason is that the foil stripslose charge to the earth through yourbody. W e say that the foil strips ar e
discharged . The process of transfe rring
of charge from a charged object to theearth is called earthing .
Earthing is provided in buildings toprotect us from electrical shocks due
to any leakage of electrical current.
15.5 The Story of Lightning
It is now possible to explain lightning
in terms of the charges produced by
rubbing.You learnt in Class VII that during
the development of a thunderstorm, the
air currents move upward while thewater droplets move downward. Thesevigorous movements cause separation
of charges. By a process, not yet
completely understood, the positivecharges collect near the upper edges ofthe clouds and the negative chargesaccumulate near the lower edges. Thereis accumulation of positive charges near
the ground also. When the magnitude
of the accumulated charges becomes verylarge, the air which is normally a poorconductor of electricity, is no longer ableto resist their flow. Negative and positivecharges meet, producing streaks of
bright light and sound. We see streaks
as lightning (Fig. 15.5). The process iscalled an electric discharge.
Fig 15.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning.
2018-19


SOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 189
The process of electric discharge can
occur between two or more clouds, or
between clouds and the earth. Today weneed not get frightened by lightning likeour ancestors did. Now we understandthe basic phenomenon. Scientists aretrying hard to improve thisunderstanding. However, lightningstrike could destroy life and property. Itis, therefore, necessary to take measuresto protect ourselves.
15.6 Lightning Safety
During lightning and thunderstorm noopen place is safe.
Hearing thunder is an alert to rushto a safer place.
After hearing the last thunder , wait
for some time before coming out ofthe safe place.
Finding a Safe Place
A house or a building is a safe place.
If you are travelling by car or by bus,
you are safe inside with windows and
doors of the vehicle shut.
Do’s and Don’ts during a
Thunderstorm
Outside
Open vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors,
construction machinery, open cars are
not safe. Open fields, tall trees, sheltersin parks, elevated places do not protect
us from lightning strokes.
Carrying an umbrella is not at all a
good idea during thunderstorms.
If in a forest, take shelter under
shorter trees.
If no shelter is available and you are
in an open field, stay far away from alltrees. Stay away from poles or othermetal objects. Do not lie on the ground.Instead, squat low on the ground. Place
your hands on your knees with yourhead between the hands (Fig. 15.6). This
position will make you the smallest
target to be struck.
Inside the house
Lightning can strike telephone cords,
electrical wires and metal pipes (Do youremember , lightning is an electrical
discharge?). During a thunderstormcontact with these should be avoided. Itis safer to use mobile phones andcordless phones. However, it is not wiseto call up a person who is receiving yourphone through a wired phone.
Bathing should be avoided during
thunderstorms to avoid contact withrunning water .
Electrical appliances like computers,
TVs, etc ., should be unplugged. Electrical
lights can remain on . They  do not cause
any harm.Fig. 15.6 : Safe position during lightning
2018-19


SCIENCE 190Lightning Conductors
Lightning Conductor is a device used
to protect buildings from the effect oflightning. A metallic rod, taller than thebuilding, is installed in the walls of thebuilding during its construction. Oneend of the rod is kept out in the air andthe other is buried deep in the ground(Fig. 15.7). The rod provides easy routefor the transfer of electric charge to theground.
The metal columns used during
construction, electrical wires and waterpipes in the buildings also protect us toan extent. But do not touch them duringa thunderstorm.15.7 Earthquakes
You just learnt about thunderstor m and
lightning.  In Class VII you learnt aboutcyclones.  These natural phenomena cancause large scale destruction of humanlife and property.  Fortunately, these
phenomena can be predicted to someextent.  The weather department can
warn about a thunderstorm developing
in some area.
If a thunderstorm occurs there is
always a possibility of lightning and
cyclones accompanying it.  So, we get
time to take measures to protect
ourselves from the damage caused by
these phenomena.

SOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 191Ther e is, however , one natural
phenomenon which we are not yet able
to predict accurately.  It is an
earthquake.  It can cause damage to
human life and property on a huge scale.
A major earthquake occurred in India
on 8 October 2005 in Uri and Tangdhar
towns of North Kashmir
(Fig. 15.8). Before that a majorearthquake occurred on 26
 January
2001 in Bhuj district of Gujarat.
Activity 15.5
Ask your parents about the hugedamage to life and property causedby these earthquakes.  Collect a fewpictures showing the damagecaused by these earthquakes fromnewspapers and magazines of thosedays.  Prepare a short report on thesuffering of the people during and
after the earthquakes.
What is an earthquake?  What
happens when it occurs?  What can wedo to minimise its effects?  These aresome of the questions which we shalldiscuss below.
What is an Earthquake?
An earthquake is a sudden shaking or
trembling of the earth which lasts for avery short time. It is caused by adisturbance deep inside the earth’s

crust.  Earthquakes occur all the time,
all over the earth.  They are not evennoticed.  Major earthquakes are muchless frequent.  They can cause immensedamage to buildings, bridges, dams andpeople.  There can be a great loss to lifeand property.  Earthquakes can causefloods, landslides and tsunamis.  Amajor tsunami occurred in the IndianOcean on 26
 December 2004.  All the
coastal areas around the ocean sufferedhuge losses.
Activity 15.6
Take an outline map of the world.Locate the eastern coast andAndaman and Nicobar Islands inIndia.  Mark other countries aroundthe Indian Ocean which could havesuffered damage.  Collect accountsof the devastation caused by thetsunami in India from your parents,or other elders in the family or in
the neighbourhood.
What Causes an Earthquake?
Fig. 15.10 : Earth platesWhat could cause a
disturbance inside
the earth?
Fig. 15.9 : Structure of the earthNow we know that the tremors are
caused by the disturbance deep downinside the uppermost layer of the earthcalled the crust  (Fig. 15.9).
In ancient times, people did not knowthe true cause of earthquakes.  Theirideas were, therefore, expressed inmythical stories such as the one told byBoojho’s grandmother. Similar mythswere prevalent in other parts of theworld.The outermost layer of the earth is
not in one piece.  It is fragmented.  Eachfragment is called a plate  (Fig. 15.10).These plates are in continual motion.When they brush past one another ,  or

Since earthquakes are caused by the
movement of plates, the boundaries ofthe plates are the weak zones whereearthquakes are more likely to occur.The weak zones are also known asseismic or fault zones .  In India, the
areas most thr eatened ar e Kashmir ,
Wester n and Central Himalayas, the
whole of North-East, Rann of Kutch,Rajasthan and the Indo–Gangetic Plane.Some areas of South India also fall inthe danger zone  (Fig. 15.12).
If scientists know so much
about earthquakes, can
they also predict when and
where the next one will
strike?
I read somewhere that
underground explosions
could also cause
tremors.
Fig. 15.11 : Movements of earth’s plates
Fig. 15.12 : Movements of Indian earth’s plate
The power of an earthquake is
expressed in terms of a magnitude
on a scale called the Richter scale .
Really destructive earthquakes havemagnitudes higher than 7 on theRichter scale.  Both Bhuj and Kashmir
earthquakes had magnitudes greater
than 7.5.Although, we know for sure what
causes an earthquake, it is not yet
possible to predict when and where thenext earthquake might occur.
Tremors on the earth can also be
caused when a volcano erupts, or ameteor hits the earth, or anunderground nuclear explosion is

SCIENCE 194The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth.  These are called
seismic waves.  The waves are recorded by an instrument called theseismograph (Fig. 15.13).  The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a
pendulum, which starts vibrating when tr emors occur.  A pen is attached to
the vibrating system.  The pen records the seismic waves on a paper whichmoves under it.  By studying these waves, scientists can construct a completemap of the earthquake, as shown in  Fig. 15.14.  They can also estimate itspower to cause destruction.

Like many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scaleis not linear .  This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have
one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4.In fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructiveenergy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more
destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.
Protection against Earthquakes
We know fr om the earlier pages that
earthquakes cannot be pr edicted.  W e
have also seen that they can be highly
destructive.  It is, therefore, important
that we take necessary precautions to
protect ourselves all the time.  Peopleliving in seismic zones, where theearthquakes are more likely to occur,have to be specially prepared.  First ofall, the buildings in these zones shouldbe so designed that they can withstandmajor tremors. Modern buildingtechnology can make it possible.

SOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 195It is advisable to make the structure
simple so that it is ‘Quake Safe’.
Consult qualified architects and
structural engineers.
In highly seismic areas, the use ofmud or timber is better than usingheavy construction material. Keeproofs as light as possible.  In casethe structure falls, the damage willnot be heavy.
It is better if the cupboards andshelves are fixed to the walls, so thatthey do not fall easily.
Be careful where you hang wallclocks, photo-frames, water heatersetc., so that in the event of anearthquake, they do not fall onpeople.
Since some buildings may catch firedue to an earthquake, it is necessarythat all buildings, especially tallbuildings, have fire fightingequipment in working order.The Central Building Research
Institute, Roorkee, has developedknowhow to make quake-resistanthouses.
In the event that an earthquake does
strike, take the following steps to protectyourself.
1. If you are at home
Take shelter under a table and stay
there till the shaking stops.
Stay away from tall and heavy objects
that may fall on you.
If you are in bed, do not get up.
Protect your head with a pillow.
2. If you are outdoors
Find a clear spot, away from
buildings, trees and overhead power
lines.  Drop to the ground.
If you are in a car or a bus, do not
come out.  Ask the driver to drive
slowly to a clear spot.  Do not comeout till the tremors stop.

LIGHTLIGHT
The world is largely known through
the senses. The sense of sight
is one of the most important
senses. Through it we see mountains,
rivers, trees, plants, chairs, people and
so many other things ar ound us. W e also
see clouds, rainbows and birds flying
in the sky. At night we see the moon
and the stars. Y ou are able to see the
words and sentences printed on this
page. How is seeing made possible?
16.1 What makes Things
Visible
Have you ever thought how we see
various objects? Y ou may say that  eyes
see the objects. But, can you see an
object in the dark? It means that eyes
alone cannot see any object. It is only
when light from an object enters our
eyes that we see the object. The light
may have been emitted by the object, or
may have been reflected by it.
You lear nt in Class VII that a polished
or a shiny sur face can act as a mirr or. A
mirror changes the direction  of light
that falls on it. Can you tell in which
dir
ection the light falling on a sur face
will be reflected? Let us find out.
16.2 Laws of Reflection
Activity 16.1
Fix a white sheet of paper on a
drawing board or a table. Take acomb and close all its openings
except one in the middle. Y ou can
use a strip of black paper for
this purpose. Hold the comb
perpendicular to the sheet of paper .
Throw light from a torch through
the opening of the comb from one
side (Fig. 16.1). With slight
adjustment of the torch and the
comb you will see a ray of light along
the paper on the other side of the
comb. Keep the comb and the torch
steady. Place a strip of plane mirror
in the path of the light ray (Fig.
16.1). What do you observe?
After striking the mirr or, the ray of
light is reflected in another direction.
The light ray, which strikes any sur face,
is called the incident ray . The ray that
comes back fr om the sur face after
reflection is known as the reflected ray .Fig. 16.1 : Arrangement for showing reflection
2018-19


SCIENCE 200
A ray of light is an idealisation. In
reality, we have a narrow beam of
light which is made up of several
rays. For simplicity, we use the term
ray for a narrow beam of light.
Draw lines showing the position of
the plane mirr or, the incident ray and
the reflected ray on the paper with the
help of your friends. Remove the mirror
and the comb. Draw a line making an
angle of 90º to the line representing the
mirror at the point where the incident
ray strikes the mirr or. This line is known
as the normal
 to the r eflecting sur face
at that point (Fig. 16.2). The angleTable 16.1 : Angles of Incidence

Do you see any relation between the
angle of incidence and the angle of
reflection. Are they approximately equal?
If the experiment is carried out carefully,
it is seen that the angle of incidence is
always equal to the angle of reflection .
This is one of the laws of reflection
.
Let us per form another activity on
reflection.
What would happen if I
threw the light on the
mirror along the normal.

time use a sheet of stiff paper or a
chart paper . Let the sheet pr oject a
little beyond the edge of the Table
(Fig. 16.4). Cut the projecting
portion of the sheet in the middle.
Look at the reflected ray. Make sure
that the reflected ray extends to the
pr
ojected portion of the paper . Bend
that part of the projected portion on
which the reflected ray falls. Can
you still see the reflected ray? Bring

instead of a torch. You, too, can use the
S
un as the source of light.
These activities can also be performed
by making use of the Ray Streak
Apparatus (available in the kit
prepared by NCER T).
Boojho remembered that in Class VII,
he had studied some features of the
image of an object formed by a plane
mirr
or. Paheli asked him to r ecall those
features:
(i)Was the image er ect or upside
down?
(ii)Was it of the same size as the
object?
(iii)Did the image appear at  the same
distance behind the mirror as the
object was in front of it?
(iv)Could it be obtained on a screen?
Let us understand a little more about
the formation of an image by a plane
mirror in the following way:
Activity 16.3
A source of light O is placed in front
of a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA
and OC are incident on it (Fig. 16.5).
Can you find out the direction of
the reflected rays?
Draw nor mals to the sur face of the
mirror PQ, at the points A and C.
Then draw the reflected rays at the
points A and C. How would you
draw these rays? Call the reflected
rays AB and CD, respectively.
Extend them further . Do they meet?
Extend them backwards. Do they
meet now? If they meet, mark this
point as I. For a viewer’s eye at E
(Fig. 16.5), do the reflected rays(b)
Fig. 16.4 (a), (b) : Incident ray, reflected ray
and the normal at the point
of incidence lie in the same
plane
When the whole sheet of paper is
spread on the table, it represents one
plane. The incident ray, the normal at
the point of incidence and the reflected
ray are all in this plane. When you bend
the paper you create a plane different
from the plane in which the incident
ray and the normal lie. Then you do not
see the reflected ray. What does it
indicate? It indicates that the incident
ray, the normal at the point of
incidence and the reflected ray all lie
in the same plane
. This is another law
of reflection.
Paheli and Booj ho per formed the
above activities outside the classroom
(a)

SCIENCE 202appear to come from the point I.
Since the reflected rays do not
actually meet at I, but only appear
to do so, we say that a virtual image
of the point O is formed at I. As you
have learnt already in Class VII,
such an image cannot be obtained
on a screen.
You may recall that in an image
formed by a  mirror the left of the object
appears on the right and the right
appears on the left. This is known as
lateral inversion .
16.3 Regular and Diffused
Reflection
Activity 16.4
Imagine that parallel rays are
incident on an irr egular sur face as
shown in Fig. 16.6. Remember that
the laws of reflection are valid at
each point of the sur face. Use these
laws to construct reflected rays at
various points. Are they parallel to
one another? Y ou will find that
these rays are reflected in different
directions. (Fig. 16.7)When all the parallel rays reflected
from a r ough or irr egular sur face ar e
not parallel, the reflection is known as
diffused  or irregular  reflection.
Remember that the diffused reflection
is not due to the failure of the laws of
reflection. It is caused by the
irregularities in the r eflecting sur face,
like that of a cardboard.
On the other hand ,
 reflection from
a smooth sur face like that of a mirr or
is called regular reflection  (Fig. 16.8).
Images are formed by regular
reflection.Fig. 16.5 : Image formation in a plane mirrorFig. 16.6 : Parallel rays incident on

dresser . She/he makes you sit in fr ont of
a mirr or. After your hair cut is complete,
she/he holds  a mirror behind you  to show
you how the hair has been cut
(Fig. 16.9). Do you know  how you could
see the hair at the back of your head?Paheli recalls having constructed a
periscope as an Extended Activity in
Class VI. The periscope makes use of
two plane mirrors. Can you explain
how reflection from the two mirrors
enables you to see objects which are
not visible directly? Periscopes are
used in submarines, tanks and also
by soldiers in bunkers to see things
outside.
16.5 Multiple Images
You ar e awar e that a plane mirr or for ms
only a single image of an object. What
happens if two plane mirrors are used
in combination? Let us see.Do W e See all Objects due to Reflected Light?
Nearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example,
receives light from the Sun and reflects it. That’s how we see the moon. The objects
which shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated  objects . Can you
name some other such objects?
There are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame
of a candle and an electric lamp. Their  light falls on our eyes. That is how we see
them. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects.

I have a question. Can the
reflected rays be further reflected
if incident on another mirror?

SCIENCE 204Activity 16.5
Take two plane mirrors. Set them
at right angles to each other with
their edges touching (Fig. 16.10). To
hinge them you can use adhesive
tape. Place a coin in between the
mirrors. How many images of the
coin do you see (Fig. 16.10)?
Now hinge the mirrors using the
adhesive tape at different angles, say
45°, 60°, 120°, 180° etc. Place some
object (say a candle) in between
them. Note down the number of
images of the object in each case.
Finally, set the two mirrors
parallel to each other . Find out how
many images of a candle placed
between them are formed (Fig.
16.11).Fig. 16.10 : Images in plane mirror at right

This idea of number of images formed
by mirrors placed at an angle to one

can also make a kaleidoscope yourself.
Kaleidoscope
Activity 16.6
To make a kaleidoscope, get three
rectangular mirror strips each about
15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join
them together to form a prism as
shown in Fig. 16.12(a). Fix this
arrangement of mirrors in a circular
cardboard tube or tube of a thick
chart paper . Make sur e that the tube
is slightly longer than the mirror
strips. Close one end of the tube by
a cardboard disc having a hole in
the centre, through which you can
see [Fig. 16.12(b)]. To make the disc
durable, paste a piece of transparent
plastic sheet under the cardboard

LIGHT 205disc. At the other end, touching the
mirrors, fix a circular plane glass
plate [Fig. 16.12(c)]. Place on this
glass plate several small pieces of
coloured glass (broken pieces of
coloured bangles). Close this end of
the tube by a ground glass plate.
Allow enough space for the colour
pieces to move around.
Your kaleidoscope is r eady. When
you peep through the hole, you will be
able to see a variety of patterns in the
tube. An interesting feature of a
kaleidoscope is that you will never see
the same pattern again. Designers of
wallpapers and fabrics and artists often
use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new
patterns. To make your toy attractive,
you can wrap the kaleidoscope in a
colour ed paper .16.6 Sunlight — White or
Coloured
In Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight
is referr
ed to as white light. Y ou also
learnt that it consists of seven colours.
Here is another activity (Activity 16.7)
showing that sunlight consists of several
colours.
16.7 What is inside Our Eyes?
We see things only when light coming
from them enters our eyes. Eye is one
of our most important sense organs. It
is, therefore, important to understand
its structure and working.
The eye has a roughly spherical
shape. The outer coat of the eye is
white. It is tough so that it can protect
the interior of the eye from accidents.
Its transparent front part is called

Place it in a bowl ( katori) as shown
in Fig. 16.13. Fill the bowl with water .
Put this arrangement near a window
in such a way that direct sunlight
falls on the mirr or. Adjust the
position of the bowl
so that the reflected
light from the
mirror falls on a
wall. If the wall is
not white, fix a sheet
of white paper on it.
Reflected light will
be seen to have
many colours. How
can you explain
this? The mirror
and water form aprism. A
s you learnt in Class VII ,
this breaks up the light into its
colours,  Splitting of light into its
colours is known as dispersion  of
light. Rainbow is a natural
phenomenon showing dispersion.

SCIENCE 206Fig. 16.15 : Demonstration of blind spotCaution : For this activity, never use
a laser torch.
Activity 16.8
Look into your friend’s eye. Observe
the size of the pupil. Throw light on
her eye with a torch. Observe the
pupil now. Switch off the torch, and
observe her pupil once again. Do
you notice any change in the size
of the pupil? In which case was the
pupil larger? Why do you think it
was so?
In which case do you need to
allow more light in the eye, when
the light is dim or bright?
Behind the pupil of the eye is a lens
which is thicker in the centre. What
kind of lens is thicker at the centre?
Recall what you learnt about lenses incornea  (Fig. 16.14).  Behind the cornea,
we find a dark muscular structure
called iris. In the iris, there is a small
opening called the pupil. The size of
the pupil is controlled by the iris. The
iris is that part of eye which gives it its
distinctive colour . When we say that a
person has green eyes, we refer actually
to the colour of the iris. The iris controls
the amount of light entering into the
eye. Let us see how.
Iris
Lens
Ciliary
muscle
Cornea
RetinaOptic
Nerve
Fig. 16.14 : Human eyeClass VII. The lens focuses light on the
back of the eye, on a layer  called retina
(Fig. 16.14). The retina contains several
nerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve
cells are then transmitted to the brain
through the optic nerve. There are two
kinds of cells–
(i)cones, which are sensitive to bright
light and
(ii)rods, which are sensitive to dim light.
Cones sense colour . At the junction
of the optic nerve and the retina, there
are no sensory cells, so no vision is
possible at that spot. This is called the
blind spot . Its existence can be
demonstrated as follows:
Activity 16.9
Make a round mark and a cross on
a sheet of paper with the spot to the
right of the cross (Fig. 16.15). The
distance between two marks may be
6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at
an arm’s length from the eye. Close
your left eye. Look continuously at
the cross. Move the sheet slowly
towards you, keeping your eye on
the cross. What do you find? Does
the round mark disappear at some
point? Now close your right eye.
Look at the round mark now and
repeat the activity. Does the cross
disappear? The disappearance of the
cross or the round mark shows that
there is a point on the retina which
cannot send messages to the brain
when light falls on it.
2018-19


LIGHT 207Nature has provided eyes with
eyelids to prevent any object from
entering the eye. Eyelids also shut out
light when not required.
Eye is such a wonder
ful instrument
that it (normal) can clearly see distant
objects as well as objects nearby . The
minimum distance at which the eye can
see objects distinctly varies with age. The
most comfortable distance at which one
can read with a normal eye is about
25 cm.
Some persons can see objects close
to them clearly but cannot see distant
objects so clearly. On the other hand,
some persons cannot see objects nearby
clearly but they can see distant objects
quite well. With suitable corrective
lenses, these defects of the eye can be
corrected.
Sometimes, particularly in old age,
eyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the
eye lens becoming cloudy. When it
happens, persons are said to have
cataract. There is a loss of vision,
sometimes extremely severe. It is
possible to treat this defect. The opaque
lens is removed and a new artificial
lens is inserted. Modern technology
has made this procedure simpler
and safer .
16.8 Care of the Eyes
It is necessary that you take proper care
of your eyes. If there is any problem
you should go to an eye specialist. Have
a regular checkup—
/circle6If advised, use suitable spectacles.
/circle6Too little or too much light is bad
for eyes. Insufficient light causes
eyestrain and headaches. Too much

a number of separate pictures in
proper sequence. They are made to
move across the eye usually at the rate
of 24 pictures  per second (faster than
16 per second). So, we see a moving
picture.
Front side of
cardboardReverse side
of cardboardThe impression of an image does not
vanish immediately from the retina. It
persists there for about 1/16th of a
second. So, if still images of a moving
object are flashed on the eye at a rate
faster than 16 per second, then the eye
perceives this object as moving.
Activity 16.10
Get a square piece of cardboard of
size 6-8 cm. Make two holes as
shown in Fig. 16.16. Thread a
string through the two holes. Draw/

side. Twist the string and make the
card twirl rapidly. Do you see the
bird in the cage?

You lear nt about balanced diet in
Class VI. If food is deficient in some
components, eyes may also suf fer. Lack
of vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible
for many eye troubles.  Most common
amongst them is night blindness.
One should, therefore, include in the
diet components which have vitamin A.
Raw carrots, broccoli and greenDid you know?
Animals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but
they enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy
approaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up of
thousands of little eyes (Fig.
16.17). They can see not only in
the front and the sides but the
back as well.
A night bird (owl) can see very
well in the night but not during
the day. On the other hand, day
light birds (kite, eagle) can see
well during the day but not in the
night. The owl has a large cornea
and a large pupil to allow more
light in its eye. Also, it has on its
retina a large number of rods and
only a few cones. The day birds
on the other hand, have more
cones and fewer rods.Fig. 16.17 : Eyes of a butterfly

vegetables (such as spinach) and cod
liver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs,
milk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits
such as papaya and mango are also rich
in vitamin A.
16.9 Visually Impaired
Persons Can Read and
Write
Some persons, including children, can
be visually impaired. They have very
limited vision to see things. Some
persons cannot see at all since birth.
Some persons may lose their eyesight
because of a disease or an injury. Such
persons try to identify things by
touching and listening to voices more
carefully. They develop their other
senses mor e sharply. However ,
additional resources can enable them
to develop their capabilities further .

LIGHT 20916.10 What is the Braille
System?
The most popular resource for visually
challenged persons is Braille .
Louis Braille
Louis Braille, himself a visually
challenged person, developed a
system for visually challenged persons
and published it in 1821.Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired
Non-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch),
auditory aids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can
magnify words, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances.
Tactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged
persons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape
recorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking
calculators  and computers , are also available for performing many computational
tasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material
with suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes
with computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text.
Optical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers
and telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual
limitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class
demonstrations.
Fig. 16.18 : Example of dot patterns used
in Braille SystemBraille system has 63 dot patterns or
characters. Each character
represents a letter , a combination of
letters, a common word or a
grammatical sign. Dots are arranged
in cells of two vertical rows of three
dots each.
Patterns of dots to represent some
English letters and some common
words are shown below.
These patterns when embossed on
Braille sheets help visually
challenged persons to recognise words
by touching. To make them easier to
touch, the dots are raised slightly.The present system was adopted in
1932. There is Braille code for common
languages, mathematics and scientific
notation. Many Indian languages can
be read using the Braille system.

SCIENCE 210
Some visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their
credit. Diwakar , a child pr odigy has given amazing per formances
as a singer .
Ravindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained
his Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his
excellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer .
Lal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an
Association for special education and rehabilitation of disabled
in India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems
in UNESCO.
Helen A. Keller , an American author and lectur er, is per haps the most well-
known and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was
only 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete
her graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The
Story of my Life  (1903).Helen A. KellerVisually impaired people learn the
Braille system by beginning with
letters,  then special characters and
letter combinations. Methods depend
upon recognition by touching. Eachcharacter has to be memorised. Braille
texts can be produced by hand or by
machine. T ypewriter -like devices and
printing machines have now been
developed.

Paheli and Boojho visited their
grandparents’ village during
the summer break. After dinner,
they 
went on to the roof of the house. It
was a clear cloudless night. They were
surprised to see a large number of  bright
stars in the sky. They had never seen such
a beautiful scene in their city (Fig. 17.1).associated with them. Night sky
watching can be a fascinating experience
at a place where there are no bright lights
and the atmosphere is clear.
Look at the sky on a dark, clear night.
You see the entire sky dotted with
countless stars, some bright and some
not so bright. Observe them carefully.
Fig. 17.1:  Night sky
Paheli wondered, why the village sky
was so different from the night sky in
big cities? Her grandfather explained that
due to bright light, smoke and dust,  the
sky in big cities i s rarely clear.
He also identified some objects seen
in the night sky and told storiesDo all of them appear to twinkle? Do
you find any star-like object which does
not twinkle? The objects which do not
twinkle are planets.
The moon is the brightest object in
the night sky. The stars, the planets,
the moon and many other objects in the
sky are called celestial objects.
2018-19


SCIENCE 216The study of celestial objects and
associated phenomena is called
astronomy . In acient India our
ancestors per formed methodical
observations of sky. Their knowledge of
astronomy was highly advanced for
their time. Passage of the Sun, stars,
moon and planets in the sky helped
them to devise calenders and almanacs.
These were often used by people in their
day to day conduct and a better
understanding of climate and rainfall
patterns for timely sowing and choice
of crops, fixing the dates of seasons and
festivals.
Let us also make some observations
of celestial objects and learn about them.
17.1 The Moon
Activity 17.1
Observe the moon continuously for
several nights, preferably from one
full moon to the next. Make a sketch
of the moon every night in your note
book and note the day from the day
of the full moon. Also note everyday
the part of the sky (east or west) in
which the moon is seen.Is there a change in the shape of the
moon everyday? Are there days when
the shape of the moon appears to be
perfectly r ound? Ar e ther e days when
the moon cannot be seen at all even if
the sky is clear?
The day on which the whole disc of
the moon is visible is known as the full
moon day. Thereafter, every night the
size of the bright part of the moon
appears to become thinner and thinner.
On the fifteenth day the moon is not
visible. This day is known as the ‘new
moon day’. The next day, only a small
portion of the moon appears in the sky.
This is known as the crescent moon.
Then again the moon grows larger every
day. On the fifteenth day once again we
get a full view of the moon.
The various shapes of the bright part
of the moon as seen during a month
are called  phases  of the moon  (Fig. 17.2).
Phases of the moon play an important
role in our social life. Almost all festivals
in India are celebrated according to the
phases of the moon. For example, Diwali
is celebrated on the new moon day;
Budh Poornima and Guru Nanak’s
birthday are celebrated on full moon
day; Maha Shivratri is celebrated on
thirteenth night of waning moon; Eid-
ul-Fitr is observed on the day following
the sighting of crescent moon.
Fig.17.2 : Phases of the moonThe time period between one full moon
to the next full moon is slightly longer
than 29 days. In many calendars this
period is called a month.
Why does the moon change
its shape every day?
2018-19


STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM 217Fig. 17.4: The moon appears different at different positions in its orbitLet us try to understand why phases
of the moon occur . You have studied in
Chapter 16 that the moon does not
produce its own light, whereas the Sun
and other stars do. We see the moon
because the sunlight falling on it gets
reflected towards us (Fig. 17.3). We,
therefore, see only that part of the moon,
from which the light of the Sun is
reflected towards us.
Activity 17.2
Take a big ball or a pitcher. Paint
half of it white and half black.
Go out into the playground with
two of your friends. Draw a circle of
radius of about 2 m on the ground.
Divide the circle into eight equal
parts as shown in Fig. 17.4.
Stand at the centre of the circle.
Ask a friend to hold the ball at
different points of the circle. Ask her
to keep the white portion of the ball
always towards the Sun. If you are
performing this activity in the
morning then the white portion of
the ball should be kept towards the
east. If the activity is being
perfor med in the after noon then the
white portion of the ball should be
kept towards the west. In each case
the line dividing the white and
black portions is kept vertical.
Standing at the centre of the
circle observe the visible white
portion of the ball while your friend
stands at the points on the circle
marked earlier. Draw the shape of
the white portion as you see it.

different phases of the moon as

around the Earth in a similar
manner.
The moon  completes one rotation on
its axis as it completes one revolution
around the Earth.
The Moon’s Surface
The moon is a fascinating object for
poets and story-tellers. But when
astronauts landed on the moon, they
found that the moon’s surface is dusty
and barren. There are many craters of
different sizes. It also has a large number
of steep and high mountains (Fig. 17.7).
Some of these are as high as the highest
mountains on the Earth.Can we hear any sound
on the moon?
We learnt in Chapter 13
that sound cannot
travel when there is no
medium. Then, how can
we hear any sound on
the moon?

no water. Can any life exist on the
moon?Did you know?
On July 21, 1969 (Indian time) the
American astronaut, Neil Armstrong,

He was followed by Edwin Aldrin.
17.2 The Stars
What other objects do you see in the
night sky? There is a large number of
stars in the sky. Observe carefully on a
dark night and from a place away from
a big city. Are all the stars equally

SCIENCE 220bright? Are they of the same colour ? In
fact, stars emit light of their own. The
Sun is also a star. Why does it appear
so large compared to the other stars?
Which appears bigger, a football
placed near you, or a football placed at
a distance of 100 m? The stars are
millions of times farther away than the
Sun. Therefore, the stars appear to us
like points.
The Sun is nearly 150,000,000
kilometres (150 million km) away from
the Earth.
The next nearest star is Alpha
Centauri. It is at a distance of about
40,000,000,000,000 km from the
Earth. Can you read this distance in
kilometres conveniently? Some stars
are even further away.
Such large distances are
expressed in another unit known as
light year .  It is the distance travelled
by light in one year. Remember that
the speed of light is about 300,000
km per second. Thus, the distance of
the Sun from the Earth may be said
to be about 8 light minutes. The
distance of Alpha Centauri is about
4.3 light years.In fact, the stars are present in the
sky during the day-time also. However,
they are not visible then because of the
bright sunlight.
Observe some prominent star or a
group of stars in the sky for about two
hours or more. What do you find? Do
you find any change in the positions of
stars in the sky?
You will find that  the stars appear
to move from east to west. A star which
rises in the east in the evening, sets in
the west in the early morning.
Why do stars appear to move from
east to west?  Let us find out.
Activity 17.4
Stand in the centre of a big room
and start rotating. In which
direction will the objects in the room
appear to move? Do you see them
moving in the direction opposite to
your motion?
Paheli recalls that when she is in a
moving train the nearby trees and
buildings appear to move in the
backward direction.
If the stars appear to move from east
to west, could it mean that the Earth,
rotates from west to east?If light from stars takes
years to reach us, I
wonder if we are looking
into the past when we
look at stars.
I want to know why we do
not see the stars during
the day. Why are they
visible only at night?Now I understand
why the Sun appears
to rise in the east and
set in the west as the
Earth rotates from
west to east on
its axis.

STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM 221
My grandfather told me that
there is one star in the sky
which does not move at all.
How is it possible?
Fig 17.10: The Pole star lies close to the axis of
rotation of the EarthThere is actually a star, the pole star,
which is situated in the direction of the
earth’s axis. It does not appear to move
(Fig. 17.10).
Constellations were devised by
ancient people to be able to recognise
stars in the sky. The shapes of
constellations resemble objects
familiar to those people.17.3 Constellations
Look at the sky for some time. Can you
see some stars forming groups with
shapes like those  in Fig. 17.11.
The stars forming a group that has a
recognisable shape is called a
constellation .
Fig. 17.9 : Pole star does not appear to move
You can easily identify some
constellations  in the night sky. For this,
you should know what a particular
constellation looks like and where to
look for it in the night sky.

Now rotate the umbrella  by holding
its central rod in your hand. Observe
the stars on the umbrella. Is there
any star which does not appear to
move? Where is this star located?
If there were a star located where the
axis of rotation of the Earth meets
the sky, could this star also be
stationary?

ladle or a question mark. There are three
stars in the handle of the ladle and four
in its bowl (Fig. 17.12).
In all ancient cultures, very interesting
mythological stories have been associated

Activity 17.7
This activity should be per formed
on a clear moonless night during
summer at about 9.00 pm. Look
towards the northern part of the sky
and identify Ursa Major. You may
get help from elders in your family.
Look at the  two stars at the end of
Ursa Major. Imagine a straight line
passing through these stars asshown in Fig. 17.13. Extend this
imaginary line towards the north
direction. (About five times the
distance between the two stars.)
This line will lead to a star which is
not too bright.  This is the Pole star.
Observe the Pole star for some time.
Note that it does not move at all as
other stars drift from east to west.
Activity 17.8
During a summer night, observe
Ursa Major 3-4 times at an interval
of 2 to 3 hours. Also locate the Pole
star each time. Does Ursa Major
appear to move from east to west?
Does it appear to revolve around the
Pole star? Compare your
observations with those in Fig.

SCIENCE 224Note that the Pole star is not visible
from the southern hemisphere. Some
of the northern constellations like
Ursa Major may also not be visible
from some points in the southern
hemisphere.
Orion  is another well-known
constellation that can be seen during
winter in the late evenings. It is one of
the most magnificent constellations in
the sky. It also has seven or eight bright
stars [Fig. 17.11(b)] Orion is also called
the Hunter. The three middle stars
represent the belt of the hunter. The
four bright stars appear to be arranged
in the form of a quadrilateral.
The star Sirius, which is the
brightest star in the sky, is located
close to Orion. To locate Sirius, imagine
a straight line passing through the
three middle stars of Orion. Look along
this line towards the east. This line will
lead you to a very bright star. It is
Sirius. (Fig. 17.15).

 Fig. 17.16Cassiopeia  is another prominent
constellation in the northern sky. It is
visible during winter in the early part
of the night. It looks like a distorted
letter W or M [Fig. 17.11(c)].
Did you know?
A constellation does not have only
5-10 stars. It has a large number of
stars (Fig. 17.16). However, we can
see only the bright stars in a
constellation with our naked eye.
All the stars which make up a
constellation are not at the same
distance. They are just in the same
line of sight in the sky.

STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM 225Let us know about some members of
the solar family.
The Sun
The Sun is the nearest star from us. It
is continuously emitting huge amounts
of heat and light. The Sun is the source
of almost all energy on the Earth. In
fact, the Sun is the main source of heat
and light for all the planets.
The Planets
The planets look like stars, but they do
not have light of their own. They merely
Fig. 17.17 :  The solar system (not to scale)
17.4 The Solar System
The Sun and the celestial bodies which
revolve around it form the solar system.
It consists of large number of bodies
such as planets, comets, asteroids and
meteors. The gravitational attraction
between the Sun and these objects
keeps them revolving around it.
The Earth, as you know, also
revolves around the Sun. It is a member
of  the solar system. It is a planet. There
are seven other planets that revolve
around the Sun. The eight planets in
their order of distance from the Sun
are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
Figure 17.17 shows a schematic view
of the solar system.
I have read that there
are nine planets in the
solar system
Did you know?
Till 2006 there were nine planets in
the solar system. Pluto was the
farthest planet from the Sun.
In 2006, the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a
new definition of a planet. Pluto does
not fit this definition. It is no longer
a planet of the solar system.
2018-19


SCIENCE 226reflect the sunlight that falls on them.
Can you distinguish between planets
and stars?
The simplest method of identifying
planets from stars is that stars twinkle,
whereas planets do not. Also the planets
keep changing their positions with
respect to the stars.
A planet has a definite path in which
it revolves around the Sun. This path is
called an orbit . The time taken by a
planet to complete one revolution is
called its period of revolution. The period
of revolution increases as the distance
of the planet increases from the su n.Besides revolving around the Sun, a
planet also rotates on its own axis like a
top (Fig. 17.19). The time taken by a
planet to complete one rotation is called
its period of rotation. I wonder why the planets do
not collide while revolving
around the Sun.
Activity 17.9
Go out into the playground with
four or five of your friends. Draw
four circles of radii 1m, 1.8m, 2.5m
and 3.8m, all having a common
centre (Fig. 17.18).
Ask one of your friends to stand
in the centre and represent the
Sun. Your other four friends may
represent Mercury, Venus, Earth
and Mars.
Ask your friends to move around
the Sun in anti-clockwise direction
in their own orbits (Fig. 17.18). Do
they collide with one another?
Fig. 17.18 : Planets move in their own orbits

Some planets are known to have
moons/satellites revolving round them.
Any celestial body revolving around
another celestial body is called its
satellite.
The Earth can be said to be a satellite
of the Sun, though generally we call it a
2018-19

satellite for the bodies revolving around
planets. Moon is a satellite of the Earth.
There are many man-made satellites
revolving round the Earth. These are
called artificial satellites.The Earth revolves
around the Sun. Does it
make Earth a satellite
of the Sun?
Astronomy in Ancient India
The practice of astronomy in ancient
India is mentioned in Rig Veda  which
was composed about 4000 years ago.
Many Indian scholars have
contributed to astronomy. One of the
most well known astronomers is
Aryabhata. The work of Aryabhata on
astronomy can be found in his
writing ‘ Aryabhatiya
’. He wrote it in
499 CE at the age of 23 years. The
diameter of the Earth as stated by
Aryabhata is close to its presently
known value. Disregarding the
popular view that Earth is ‘ achala ’
(immovable), Aryabhata stated that
Earth is sphere and rotates on its own
axis. His estimate about the sidereal
period of Earth was 23 hours, 56
minutes and 4.1 seconds, which is
very close to the presently known
value. He also correctly stated that
the moon and the planets shine due
to reflected sunlight. He also gave a
scientific explanation for solar and
lunar eclipses. When the shadow ofthe Earth falls on the
moon, it causes lunar
eclipse. When the
shadow of the moon
falls on the Earth, it
causes solar eclipse.
Aryabhata also found
the distance between
the Earth and the
moon, which is very
close to the known
value today.
Mercury (Budh)
The planet mercury is nearest to the
Sun. It is the smallest planet of our
solar system. Because Mercury is very
close to the Sun, it is very difficult to
observe it, as most of the time it is
hidden in the glare of the Sun.
However, it can be observed just before
sunrise or just after sunset, near the
horizon. So it is visible only at places
where trees or buildings do not obstruct
the view of the horizon. Mercury has
no satellite of its own.
Aryabhata
C.E. 476 - 550
Venus (Shukra)
Venus is earth’s nearest planetary
neighbour. It is the brightest planet in
the night sky.
2018-19


SCIENCE 228The Earth is the only planet in the solar
system on which life is known to exist.
Some special environmental conditions
are responsible for the existence and
continuation of life on the Earth. These
include just the right distance from the
Sun, so that it has the right temperature
range, the presence of water and suitable
atmosphere and a blanket of ozone.Sometimes V enus appears in the
eastern  sky before sunrise. Sometimes
it appears in the western sky just after
sunset. Therefore it is often called a
morning or an evening star, although it
is not a star. Try to locate Venus in the
night sky.
Venus has no moon or satellite of its
own. Rotation of Venus on its axis is
somewhat unusual. It rotates from east
to west while the Earth rotates from west
to east.
Activity 17.10
Find out from some newspaper or
from an almanac the time when
Venus is visible in the sky. You can
easily recognise Venus by its
brightness. Remember that Venus
cannot be seen very high in the sky.
You must try to observe Venus
either 1-3 hours before sunrise or
1-3 hours after sunset.
Fig. 17.20 :  Phases of Venus
We must take special care to
protect our environment so that
life on Earth is not disturbed.
From space, the Earth appears blue-
green due to the reflection of light from
water and landmass on its surface.
The axis of rotation of the Earth is
not perpendicular to the plane of its
orbit. The tilt is responsible for the
change of seasons on the Earth. The
Earth has only one moon.
If you get a chance, try to observe
Venus through a telescope. You will
observe that Venus shows phases just
like the moon (Fig. 17.20).
Does it mean that on Venus,
the Sun would rise in the
west and set in the east?

revolves round the Sun is called the
orbital plane of the Earth (Fig. 17.21).
These two planes are inclined to each
other at an angle of 23.5º. This
means that the axis of the Earth is
inclined to its orbital plane at an
angle of 66.5º.
slightly reddish and, therefore, it is also
called the red planet. Mars has two small
natural satellites.
Mangalyaan
Indian Space Research Organisation
(ISRO) launched India’s first Mars
orbiter mission – Mangalyaan, on
November 5, 2013. It was successfully
placed into an orbit of Mars on
September 24, 2014. With this India
became the first country in the world
to do so in its first attempt.
Jupiter (Brihaspati)
Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar
system. It is so large that about 1300
earths can be placed inside this giant
planet. However, the mass of Jupiter is
about 318 times that of our Earth. It
rotates very rapidly on its axis.
Jupiter has a large number of
satellites. It also has faint rings around
it. You can easily recognise Jupiter as it
appears quite bright in the sky. If you
observe it with the help of a telescope,
you can also see four of its large moons
(Fig. 17.22).

Fig. 17.23 :  Saturn is less dense than water
Boojho has a
naughty idea! “If
we imagine Saturn
in a large pool of
water then it will
float (Fig. 17.23)
Fig. 17.24 : Uranus in its orbital pathSaturn (Shani)
Beyond Jupiter is Saturn which appears
yellowish in colour. What makes it
unique in the solar system is its
beautiful rings. These rings are not
visible with the naked eye. You can
observe them with a small  telescope.
Saturn also has a large number of
satellites.I have an idea! If you take a
large ball which can accommodate
about 1300 peas, then the ball will
represent Jupiter and one pea will
represent the Earth.
One interesting thing about Saturn
is that it is the least dense among all
the planets. Its density is less than that
of water.
Uranus and Neptune
These are the outermost planets of the
solar system. They can be seen only with
the help of large telescopes. Like Venus,
Uranus also rotates from east to west.
The most remarkable feature of Uranus
is that it has highly tilted rotational axis
2018-19


STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM 231(Fig. 17.24). As a result, in its orbital
motion it appears to roll on its side.
The first four planets, Mercury,
Venus, Earth and Mars are much nearer
the Sun than the other four planets.
They are called the inner planets. The
inner planets have very few moons.
The planets outside the orbit of Mars,
namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune are much farther off than the
inner planets. They are called the outer
planets. They have a ring system around
them. The outer planets have large
number of moons.
17.5 Some Other Members of
the Solar System
There are some other bodies which
revolve around the Sun. They are also
members of the solar system. Let us
learn about some of them.
Asteroids
Fig. 17.25 :  The Asteroid beltAsteroids
There is a large gap in between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter (Fig. 17.25). This
gap is occupied by a large number of
small objects that revolve around the
Sun. These are called asteroids .
Asteroids can only be seen through
large telescopes.
Comets
Comets are also members of our solar
system. They revolve around the Sun
in highly elliptical orbits. However, their
period of revolution round the Sun is
usually very long. A Comet appears
generally as a bright head with a long
tail. The length of the tail grows in size
as it approaches the sun. The tail of a
comet is always directed away from the
sun (Fig. 17.26).
2018-19


SCIENCE 232Fig. 17.26 :  Different position of a Comet
Many comets are known to appear
periodically. One such comet is Halley’s
comet, which appears after nearly every
76 years. It was last seen in 1986. Can
you tell, when Halley’s comet will be
visible again?
Superstitions about the Comets
Some people think that comets are
messengers of disasters, such as
wars, epidemics and floods. But these
are all myths and superstitions.
Appearance of a comet is a natural
phenomenon. We have no reason to
be afraid of it.
Meteors and Meteorites
At night, when the sky is clear and the
moon is not there, you may sometimes
see bright streaks of light in the sky (Fig.
17.27). These are commonly known as
shooting stars, although they are not
stars. They are called meteors . A meteor
is usually a small object that
occasionally enters the earth’s
atmosphere. At that time it has a very
high speed. The friction due to the
atmosphere heats it up. It glows and
evaporates quickly. That is why the
bright steak lasts for a very short time.Fig. 17.27 :  Streak of a Meteor
Some meteors are large and so they
can reach the Earth before they
evaporate completely. The body that
reaches the Earth is called a meteorite .
Meteorites help scientists in
investigating the nature of the material
from which the solar system was formed.
Meteor Showers
When the Earth crosses the tail of a
comet, swarms of meteors are seen.
These are known as meteor showers.
Some meteor showers occur at
regular intervals each year. You can
find the time of their appearance from
a scientific magazine or from the
internet.
Artificial Satellites
You must have heard that there are a
number of artificial satellites which are
orbiting the Earth. You might wonder
how artificial satellites are different from
natural satellites. Artificial satellites are
man-made. They are launched from the
Earth. They revolve around the Earth
much closer than earth’s natural
satellite, the moon.

STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM 233I want to tell you that by remote
sensing we mean collecting
information from a distance.
ISRO
Fig. 17.28 : Some Indian satellitesIndia has built and launched several
artificial satellites. Aryabhata was the
first Indian satellite. Some other Indian
satellites are INSAT, IRS, Kalpana-1,
EDUSAT, etc. (Fig. 17.28).
Artificial satellites have many
practical applications. They are used for
forecasting weather, transmitting
television and radio signals. They arealso used for telecommunication and
remote sensing.

1.The North-South line at your place
Let us learn to draw the north-south line
with the help of the shadow of a stick. Fix a
straight stick vertically in the ground where
the Sun can be seen for most of the day.
Call the foot of the stick as point O.
Sometime in the morning, mark the tip of
the shadow of the stick.   Say this point is
A. With OA as radius draw a circle on the
ground. Wait till the shadow becomes
shorter and then starts increasing in size.
When the shadow again touches the circle,
mark it as point B. Draw the bisector of the
angle AOB.  This is your North-South line.
To decide which side of this line shows North, use a magnetic
compass.

be sufficient if you take the observation once every week. On any
day, note down the direction of the rising Sun. Repeat this
observation every week. What do you find? Y ou would have noted
that the point of sunrise changes continuously. From summer
solstice  (around 21 June), the point of sunrise gradually shifts
towards the south. The Sun is then said to be in dakshinayan
(moving south). It keeps doing so till winter solstice  (around 22
December). Ther eafter , the point of sunrise changes dir ection and
starts moving towards north. The Sun is now said to be in uttarayan
(moving north). Fr om the equator , only on two days, on the days of
the 
equinoxes  (around 21 March and 23 September) the Sun rises
in the east. On all other days, it rises either north of east or south
of east. So, the direction of the rising Sun is not a good guide to
determine directions. The Pole Star, which defines North, is a much
better indicator of directions.

Kalpana Chawla: The First Indian Woman in Space
Kalpana Chawla is the first Indian woman astronaut. She
was born on 17 March 1962 in  Karnal, Haryana. She did
her Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical
Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh.
In 1982, she moved to USA and obtained a Master of
Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the
University of Texas and Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from
University of Colorado. In 1988, she started working in NASA
and was selected for her first flight in 1996. She was the
first Indian-born woman and the second Indian person to fly in space. Unfortunately she was
one of the seven astronauts who lost their lives in Space Shuttle Columbia disaster on
1 February 2003. She is a role model for many young women around the world.
Did You Know ?
In ancient times, it was believed that the Earth was at the centre of the universe and the
moon, the planets, the Sun and stars were orbiting around it. About 500 years ago, a Polish
priest and astronomer, named Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543), stated that the Sun was
at the centre of the solar system and the planets revolved around it. It was a revolutionary
idea. Even Copernicus hesitated to publish his work. His work was published in the year of
his death in 1543.
In 1609, Galileo designed his own telescope. Through this telescope Galileo
observed moons of Jupiter, phases of Venus and rings of Saturn. He argued that all the
planets must orbit the Sun and not  the Earth.
Thus you can see that ideas and concepts grow and change. How about your own ideas?
Do you keep your mind open to accept new ideas when there is good evidence to support it?

POLLUTION  OF AIR AND WATER POLLUTION  OF AIR AND WATER
Paheli and Boojho were very excited
to know  that Taj Mahal in Agra
is  one of the seven wonders of
the world. But they were disappointed
to hear that the beauty of this
monument in white marble is being
threatened by air pollution in the area
surrounding the Taj. They were eager
to know if something can be done to
control the air and water pollution.
We ar e all awar e that our
environment is not what it used to be.
Our elders talk about the clean water
and fresh air that was available in their
times. Now the media regularly reports
on the falling quality of the environment.
We ourselves feel the impact of the falling
quality of air and water in our lives. The
number of people suffering from diseases
of the respiratory system, for example,
is steadily rising.
We shudder to imagine a time when
clean air and water may no longer be
available! Y ou have lear nt about the
importance of air and water in your
pr
evious classes. In this chapter , we will
study about the harmful changes taking
place in our surroundings and their
effects on our lives.
18.1 Air Pollution
We can survive for some time without food,
but we cannot survive even for a few
minutes without air . This simple fact tells
us how important clean air is to us.You alr eady know that air consists
of a mixture of gases. By volume, about
78% of this mixture is nitrogen and
about 21% is oxygen. Carbon dioxide,
argon, methane, ozone and water
vapour are also present in very small
quantities.
Activity 18.1
You may have cover ed your nose
while passing a brick kiln emitting
smoke or started coughing while
walking on a busy road (Fig. 18.1).
On the basis of your experience,
compare the quality of air at the
places given below:
/circle6A park and a busy road.
/circle6A residential area and an
industrial area.
/circle6A busy traffic  intersection at
different times of the day e.g.
early morning, afternoon and
evening.

SCIENCE 240
Fig. 18.3 :  Air pollution due to automobilesOne of your observations in the
above activity could be the differences
in the amount of smoke in the
atmosphere. Do you know where the
smoke could have come from? Addition
of such substances to the atmosphere
modifies it. When air is contaminated
by  unwanted substances which have
a harmful effect on both the living and
the non-living, it is referred to as air
pollution .
18.2 How does Air Get Polluted?
The substances which contaminate the
air are called air pollutants . Sometimes,
such substances may come from natural
sources like smoke and dust arising from
forest fires or volcanic eruptions.
Pollutants are also added to the
atmosphere by certain human activities.
The sources of air pollutants are
factories (Fig. 18.2), power plants,
automobile exhausts and burning of
firewood and dung cakes.Activity 18.2
You might have r ead in the
newspapers that respiratory
problems amongst children
are rising day by day. Conduct a
survey of households in your
neighbourhood and among friends
to find out how many children are
suffering from respiratory problems.
Many respiratory problems are
caused by air pollution. Let us now try
to find out the substances or pollutants
which ar e present in the polluted air .
Have you noticed how rapidly the
number of vehicles is increasing in our
cities?
Vehicles pr oduce high levels of
pollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke (Fig.
18.3). Carbon monoxide is produced
from incomplete burning of fuels such
as petrol and diesel. It is a poisonous
gas. It reduces the oxygen-carrying
capacity of the blood.
Fig. 18.2 :  Smoke from a factoryDo you know?
If the vehicles registered in Delhi are
lined up one after the other , the total
length would be nearly equal to the
combined lengths of the two longest
rivers in the world, Nile and Amazon!
2018-19


POLLUTION  OF AIR AND WATER 241
Boojho  remembers  seeing a thick
fog-like layer in the atmosphere,
especially during winters. This is smog
which is made up of smoke and fog.
Smoke may contain oxides of nitrogen
which combine with other air pollutants
and fog to form smog. The smog causes
breathing difficulties such as asthma,
cough and wheezing in children.
Many industries are also responsible
for causing air pollution. Petroleum
refineries are a major source of gaseous
pollutants like sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is
produced by combustion of fuels like
coal in power plants. It can cause
respiratory problems, including
permanent lung damage.  Y ou have
already studied about the burning of
fossil fuels in Chapter 5.
Other kinds of pollutants are
chlorofluorocarbons
 (CFCs) which are
used in refrigerators, air conditioners
and aerosol sprays. CFCs damage the
ozone layer of the atmosphere. Recall
that the ozone layer protects us from
harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Have
you hear d of the ozone hole? T ry to find
out about it. Thankfully, less harmful
chemicals are now being used in place
of CFCs.
In addition to the above mentioned
gases, automobiles which burn diesel
and petrol, also produce tiny particles
which remain suspended in air for long
periods (Fig. 18.3). They reduce
visibility. When inhaled, they cause
diseases. Such particles are also
produced during industrial processes
like steel making and mining. Power
plants give out tiny ash particles which
also pollute the atmosphere.Activity 18.3
Prepare a table using the pollutants
mentioned above. Y ou may even add
more data to the following Table.

Air Pollutants Sources Effects
18.3 Case Study—
The Taj Mahal
Over the past 2 decades, India’s most
famous tourist attraction, Taj Mahal
located in Agra (Fig. 18.4), has become
a matter of concern. Experts have
warned that pollutants in air are
discolouring its white marble. So, it is
not only living organisms that get
affected by polluted air but non-living
things like buildings, monuments and
statues also get affected.
The industries located in and around
Agra like rubber processing, automobile,
chemicals and especially the Mathura oil
refinery, have been responsible for
producing pollutants like sulphur
dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These
gases react with the water vapour present
in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid
and nitric acid. The acid s drop down with
rain, making the rain acidic. This is
called acid rain. Acid rain corrodes the
marble of the monument. The
phenomenon is also called “Marble
cancer”. Suspended particulate matter
,
such as the soot particle s emitted by
Mathura oil refinery, has contributed
towards the yellowing of the marble.
The Supreme Court has taken
several steps to save the Taj. It has

A part of the reflected radiation is
trapped by the atmosphere. The trapped
radiations further warm the earth. If you
have seen a greenhouse in a nursery or
elsewhere, recall that the sun’s heat is
allowed to get in but is not allowed to
go out. The trapped heat warms the
green house. The trapping of radiations
by the earth’s atmospher e is similar .
That is why it is called the greenhouse
effect
. Without this process, life would
not have been possible on the earth. But
now it threatens life. Excess of CO2 in
the air is one of the gases responsible
for this effect.
You know that CO2 is one of the
components of air . You have also studiedI am reminded of the
chapter on crops. I
wonder whether acid rain
affects the soil and
plants also.
But how does CO2 content
rise in the atmosphere and
become excessive?ordered industries to switch to cleaner
fuels like CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)
and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas).
Moreover , the automobiles should
switch over to unleaded petrol in the Taj
zone.
Discuss with your elders and see
what they have to say about the
condition of the Taj, 20 or 30 years ago!

earth’s sur face. A part of the radiation
that falls on the earth is absorbed by it

POLLUTION  OF AIR AND WATER 243the role of carbon dioxide in plants. But
if ther e is excess of CO2 in the air , it
acts as a pollutant.
Can you help Paheli find out  the
answer to her question?
On the one hand, CO2 is continuously
being released because of human
activities. On the other hand, area under
forests is decreasing. Plants utili se CO2
from the atmosphere for photosynthesis,
thereby decreasing the amount of CO2
in the air . Defor estation leads to an
increase in the amount of CO2 in the air
because the number of trees which
consume CO2 is reduced. Human
activities, thus, contribute to the
accumulation of CO2 in the  atmosphere.
CO2 traps heat and does not allow it to
escape into space. As a result, the average
temperature of the earth’s atmosphere
is gradually increasing. This is called
global warming .
Other gases like methane, nitrous
oxide and water vapour also contribute
Global W arming
A Serious Threat!
Global warming can cause sea levels
to rise dramatically. In many places,
coastal areas have already been
flooded. Global warming could result
in wide ranging effects on rainfall
patterns, agriculture, forests, plants
and animals. Majority of people living
in regions which are threatened by
global warming are in Asia. A recent
climate change report gives us only
a limited time to keep  the greenhouse
gases at the present level. Otherwise,
the temperature may rise by more
than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of
the century, a level considered
dangerous.towards this effect. Like CO2, they are
also called greenhouse gases .
Global warming has become a major
concern for governments worldwide.
Many countries have reached an
agreement to reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol
is one such agreement.
Boojho is surprised to hear that an
increase in the earth’s temperature by
even as little as 0.5 °C can have such a
serious effect!  Paheli tells him that she
had read in the newspapers recently that
the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas
has started melting because of global
warming.
18.5 What can be Done?
What can we do to reduce air
pollution?
There are many success stories in our
fight against air pollution. For example,
a few years ago, Delhi was one of the
most polluted cities in the world. It was
being choked by fumes released from
automobiles running on diesel and
petrol. A decision was taken to switch
to fuels like CNG (Fig. 18.5) and

resulted in cleaner air for the city. Y ou
might know of some other examples
from your area regarding reduction of
air pollution. Share these with your
friends.fuels for our energy requirements. These
could be solar energy, hydropower and
wind energy.
Activity 18.4
You have various options of
commuting to your school such as
walking, going by bicycle, travelling
by bus or other public transport,
using a car individually, travelling
by car pool. Discuss in your class
the impact of each of these options
on the quality of air.
Small contributions on our part can
make a huge difference in the state of
the envir onment. W e can plant tr ees and
nurture the ones already present in the
neighbour hood. Do you know about Van
Mahotsav , when lakhs of trees are
planted in July every year (Fig. 18.6)?
Fig. 18.6 :  Children planting saplingsDo you know about the “Say no to
crackers” campaign which was
organised by children from many
schools? This made a big difference
to the air pollution levels around
Diwali.
The quality of air at various locations
is monitored regularly by government
and other agencies. W e can use this data
to generate awareness about air
pollution among friends and
neighbours.
There is a need to switch over to
alternative fuels instead of the fossil

go to an area where some people were
burning dry leaves. They started
coughing because the entire area was full

better option to  put them in a compost
pit rather than burning. What do you
think?
18.6  W ater Pollution
In Class VII you learnt that water is a
precious resource. Think and list the
various activities in which we need
water . We saw that water is becoming
scarce due to increase in population,
industries and agricultural activities.
You have also studied how water
becomes “dirty” after we use it for
washing clothes, bathing, etc. This
means that we are adding some
materials to the water , which spoil its
quality and change its smell and colour .
Whenever harmful substances such
as sewage, toxic chemicals, silt, etc., get
mixed with water , the water becomes
polluted. The substances that pollute
water are called water pollutants .Activity 18.5
Try to collect samples of water fr om
a tap, pond, river , well and lake.

containers. Compare these for

livelihood. However , recently a study by
the W orld W ide Fund for Natur e (WWF)
found that Ganga is one of the ten most
endangered rivers in the world. The
pollution levels have been rising for
many years. W e have reached this stage
because the towns and cities, through
which the river flows, throw large
quantities of garbage, untreated sewage,
dead bodies, and many other harmful
things, dir ectly into the river . In fact the
river is ‘dead’  at many places where the
pollution levels are so high that aquatic
life cannot survive.
An ambitious plan to save the river ,
called the Ganga Action Plan  was
launched in 1985. It aimed to reduce
the pollution levels in the river . However ,
the increasing population and
industrialisation have already damaged
this mighty river beyond r epair. Now, the
Government of India has launched a new
initiative known as National Mission for
Clean Ganga (NMCG) in 2016.
Let us take a specific example to
understand the situation. The Ganga
at Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh (U.P .), has
one of the most polluted stretches of
the river (Fig. 18.8). Kanpur is one of
the most populated towns in U.P .People can be seen bathing, washing
clothes and defecating in the river .
They also throw garbage, flowers,
idols of gods and god desses and non-
biodegradable polythene bags into the
river.
At Kanpur the amount of water is
comparatively small and the flow of the
river is very slow. In addition, Kanpur
has more than 5000 industries. These
include fertiliser , deter gent, leather and
paint industries. These industrial units
discharge toxic chemical wastes into the
river.
Based on the above information
think of the answers to the following
questions –
/circle6What are the factors responsible for
pollution of the river ?
/circle6What steps can be taken to restore
the river Ganga to its past glory ?
/circle6How would the disposal of garbage,
etc., affect the living organisms in the
river ?
Many industries discharge harmful
chemicals into rivers and streams,
causing the pollution of water
(Fig. 18.9). Examples are  oil refineries,
paper factories, textile and sugar mills
Fig. 18.9 :  Industrial waste discharged into
a riverFig. 18.8 : A polluted stretch of the river
Ganga
2018-19


POLLUTION  OF AIR AND WATER 247and chemical factories. These industries
cause chemical contamination of water .
The chemicals released include  arsenic,
lead and fluorides which lead to toxicity
in plants and animals.  There are
regulations to prevent this. Industries
are supposed to treat the waste
produced before discharging it into
waters, but quite often the rules are not
followed. The soil is also affected by
impur e water
, causing changes in
acidity, growth of worms, etc.
We have lear nt in Chapter 1 the
importance of pesticides and weedicides
for the pr otection of cr ops. However , all
these chemicals dissolve in water and
are washed into water bodies from the
fields. They also seep into the ground
to pollute ground water .
Have you seen ponds which look
green from a distance because they have
a lot of algae growing in them? This is
caused by excessive quantities of
chemicals which get washed from the
fields. These act as nutrients for algae
to flourish. Once these algae die, they
serve as food for decomposers like
bacteria. A lot of oxygen in the water
body gets used up. This results in a
decrease in the oxygen level which may
kill aquatic organisms.
Recall Activity 18.6
You had investigated the sewage
disposal system of your locality in
Class VII.
Do you remember how the
sewage was collected from your
home and where it went thereafter?
Sometimes untreated sewage is
thrown directly into rivers. It containsfood wastes, deter gents, micr oor-
ganisms, etc. Can ground water get
polluted by sewage? How?  W ater
contaminated with sewage may contain
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites
which cause diseases like cholera,
typhoid and jaundice.
The bacteria present in the faeces
of mammals are indicators of the
quality of water . If water has these
bacteria, it means that it has been
contaminated by fecal matter . If such
water is used by us, it can cause various
infections.
Do you know?
Hot water can also be a pollutant !
This is usually water from power
plants and industries.  It is released
into the rivers. It raises the
temperature of the waterbody,
adversely affecting the animals and
plants living in it.
18.8 What is Potable W ater
and How is W ater
Purified ?
Activity 18.7
Let us construct a water filter with
simple, everyday materials.
Take a plastic bottle and cut it
into 2 halves at the centre. Use the
upper half as a funnel by putting it
upside down in the lower half. Make
layers in it with paper napkin or a
fine cloth followed by, cotton, sand
and then gravel. Now pour dirty
water through the filter and observe
the filter ed water .

SCIENCE 248Discuss the following questions
amongst yourselves and with your
teacher:
/circle6Why do we need to filter water
before drinking ?
/circle6Where do you get your drinking
water from?
/circle6What will happen if we drink
polluted water?
Boojho is very upset.  He tells   Paheli
that he drank water  which looked clear
and was without any smell, but still he
fell sick !
Paheli explains that water which
looks clean may still have disease-
carrying microorganisms and dissolved
impurities. So, it is essential to purify
water before drinking, for example, by
boiling.
Water which is suitable for drinking
is called potable water
. You have seen
how various physical and chemical
processes in the sewage treatment
plants help to clean water before
discharging it into water bodies.
Similarly, municipal bodies treat the
water before supplying it to households.water . Boiling kills the ger ms pr esent
in the water .
/circle6Chlorination is a commonly used
chemical method for purifying water .
It is done by adding chlorine tablets
or bleaching powder to the water . We
must be cautious. W e should not
use more chlorine tablets than
specified.
18.9 What Can be Done?
Activity  18.8
Investigate the level of awareness
about  water pollution in your area.
Collect data on the sources of
drinking water and the methods of
sewage disposal.
What ar e the common water -borne
diseases in the community? Y ou can
consult your local doctor/health
worker for this.
Which are the governmental and
non-governmental organisations
working in this field? What are the
measures being taken by them for
generating awareness?
Laws for industrial units should be
strictly implemented so that polluted
water is not disposed off directly into
rivers and lakes. W ater tr eatment plants
should be  installed in all industrial
areas (Fig. 18.10). At our individual
levels we should consciously save water
and not waste it. Reduce , reuse  and
recycle  should be our mantra !
Think of your daily routine – how
can you save water?
We can think of cr eative ideas like
reusing water used for washing and for
other household tasks. For example,Do you know?
25% of the world’s population is
without safe drinking water !
Let us see how water can be made
safe for drinking:

survival of our planet is in danger .
