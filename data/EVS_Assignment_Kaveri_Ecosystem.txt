EVS Assignment: Ecosystem in Kaveri and Its Pollutants
Name: Harish T
Roll Number: 23AM019
Class: AIML - A
Subject: Environmental Studies
Topic: Ecosystem in Kaveri and Its Pollutants
Introduction:
The Kaveri River, also known as the Cauvery, is one of the major rivers in southern India. It plays a
crucial role in supporting biodiversity and providing water for agriculture, drinking, and industry.
However, due to rising pollution, the Kaveri ecosystem faces significant threats.
The Ecosystem in the Kaveri River Basin:
- Aquatic Life: Includes mahseer, catla, and other freshwater fish.
- Flora: Wetland plants, neem, tamarind, bamboo.
- Fauna: Birds like kingfishers and herons, amphibians, otters.
- Agriculture: Fertile plains grow rice, sugarcane, banana.
- Forests: Western Ghats provide rich biodiversity.
Pollutants in the Kaveri River:
1. Industrial Waste: Textile and chemical industries release harmful effluents.
2. Domestic Sewage: Urban centers discharge untreated waste.
3. Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers and pesticides cause eutrophication.
4. Plastic and Solid Waste: Non-biodegradable materials choke aquatic life.
5. Sand Mining: Affects riverbanks and habitats.
Impact of Pollution on Kaveri Ecosystem:
- Decline in aquatic species.
- Biodiversity loss.

EVS Assignment: Ecosystem in Kaveri and Its Pollutants
- Unsafe drinking water.
- Soil degradation.
Measures to Protect the Ecosystem:
- Strict waste disposal laws.
- Promote organic farming.
- Establish sewage treatment plants.
- Community clean-up drives.
- Environmental education.
Case Study: Pollution in Erode District, Tamil Nadu
The Erode region, known for textile production, discharges large volumes of untreated dye waste
into the Kaveri. Studies showed high levels of heavy metals in the river water affecting both aquatic
life and crop quality. In response, local NGOs partnered with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board
to monitor effluent discharge. Installation of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) reduced
chemical pollutants by over 40%, but continuous monitoring is still essential.
Conclusion:
Kaveri River's ecosystem is vital for environmental and human survival in southern India. It is our
responsibility to ensure it remains clean and healthy. Government policies, community involvement,
and sustainable practices are the keys to restoration.
